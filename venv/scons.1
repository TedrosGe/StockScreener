.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fBscons\fR
orchestrates the construction of software (and other tangible products such as documentation files) by determining which component pieces must be built or rebuilt and invoking the necessary commands to build them\&.
SCons
offers many features to improve developer productivity such as parallel builds, caching of build artifacts, automatic dependency scanning, and a database of information about previous builds so details do not have to be recalculated each run\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
requires
Python
3\&.6 or later to run; there should be no other dependencies or requirements, unless the experimental Ninja tool is used\&.
.PP

\fIChanged in version 4\&.3\&.0:\fR
support for
Python
3\&.5 is removed; the CPython project has retired 3\&.5:
\m[blue]\fB\%https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0478\fR\m[]\&.
.PP
You set up an
SCons
build system by writing a script that describes things to build (targets), and, if necessary, the rules to build those files (actions)\&.
SCons
comes with a collection of
Builder
methods which apply premade actions for building many common software components such as executable programs, object files and libraries, so that for many software projects, only the targets and input files (sources) need be specified in a call to a builder\&.
SCons
thus can operate at a level of abstraction above that of pure filenames\&. For example if you specify a library target named "foo",
SCons
keeps track of the actual operating system dependent filename (such as
libfoo\&.so
on a GNU/Linux system), and how to refer to that library in later construction steps that want to use it, so you don\*(Aqt have to specify that precise information yourself\&.
SCons
can also scan automatically for dependency information, such as header files included by source code files (for example,
#include
preprocessor directives in C or C++ files), so these
implicit dependencies
do not have to be specified manually\&.
SCons
supports the ability to define new scanners to support additional input file types\&.
.PP
Information about files involved in the build, including a cryptographic hash of the contents of source files, is cached for later reuse\&. By default this hash (the
content signature) is used to determine if a file has changed since the last build, although this can be controlled by selecting an appropriate
\fBDecider\fR
function\&. Implicit dependency files are also part of out\-of\-date computation\&. The scanned implicit dependency information can optionally be cached and used to speed up future builds\&. A hash of each executed build action (the
build signature) is cached, so that changes to build instructions (changing flags, etc\&.) or to the build tools themselves (new version) can also trigger a rebuild\&.
.PP

SCons
supports the concept of separated source and build directories through the definition of
variant directories
(see the
\fBVariantDir\fR
function)\&.
.PP
When invoked,
\fBscons\fR
looks for a file named
SConstruct
in the current directory and reads the build configuration from that file (other names are allowed, see
the section called \(lqSConscript Files\(rq
and the
\fB\-f\fR
option for more information)\&. The build may be structured in a hierarchical manner: the
SConstruct
file may specify subsidiary configuration files by calling the
\fBSConscript\fR
function, and these may, in turn, do the same\&. By convention, these subsidiary files are named
SConscript, although any name may be used\&. As a result of this naming convention, the term
SConscript files
is used to refer generically to the complete set of configuration files for a project (including the
SConstruct
file), regardless of the actual file names or number of such files\&. A hierarchical build is not recursive \- all of the SConscript files are processed in a single pass, although each is processed in a separate context so as not to interfere with one another\&.
SCons
provides mechanisms for information to be shared between SConscript files when needed\&.
.PP
Before reading the
SConscript
files,
\fBscons\fR
looks for a directory named
site_scons
in various system directories and in the directory containing the
SConstruct
file or, if specified, the directory from the
\fB\-\-site\-dir\fR
option instead, and prepends the ones it finds to the
Python
module search path (\fIsys\&.path\fR), thus allowing modules in such directories to be imported in the normal
Python
way in
SConscript
files\&. For each found site directory, (1) if it contains a file
site_init\&.py
that file is evaluated, and (2) if it contains a directory
site_tools
the path to that directory is prepended to the default toolpath\&. See the
\fB\-\-site\-dir\fR
and
\fB\-\-no\-site\-dir\fR
options for details on default paths and controlling the site directories\&.
.PP

SConscript
files are written in the
Python
programming language, although it is normally not necessary to be a
Python
programmer to use
\fBscons\fR
effectively\&.
SConscript
files are invoked in a context that makes the facilities described in this manual page available in their local namespace without any special steps\&. Standard
Python
scripting capabilities such as flow control, data manipulation, and imported
Python
libraries are available to use to handle complicated build situations\&. Other
Python
files can be made a part of the build system, but they do not automatically have the
SCons
context and need to import it if they need access (described later)\&.
.PP

\fBscons\fR
reads and executes all of the included
SConscript
files
\fIbefore\fR
it begins building any targets\&. To make this clear,
\fBscons\fR
prints the following messages about what it is doing:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBscons foo\&.out\fR
scons: Reading SConscript files \&.\&.\&.
scons: done reading SConscript files\&.
scons: Building targets  \&.\&.\&.
cp foo\&.in foo\&.out
scons: done building targets\&.
$
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The status messages (lines beginning with the
scons:
tag) may be suppressed using the
\fB\-Q\fR
option\&.
.PP
To assure reproducible builds,
SCons
uses a restricted
execution environment
for running external commands used to build targets, rather then propagating the full environment in effect at the time
\fBscons\fR
was called\&. This helps avoid problems like picking up accidental settings, temporary debug values that are no longer needed, or one developer having different settings than another (or than the CI/CD pipeline)\&. Environment variables that are needed for proper operation of such commands need to be set explicitly, which can be done either by assigning the desired values, or by picking values individually out of environment variables using the
Python
os\&.environ
dictionary\&. The execution environment for a given
construction environment
is contained in its
\fB$ENV\fR
construction variable\&. A few environment variables are picked up automatically \- see
the section called \(lqENVIRONMENT\(rq)\&.
.PP
In particular, if the compiler or other commands that you want to use to build your target files are not in standard system locations,
\fBscons\fR
will not find them unless you explicitly include the locations into the
\fIPATH\fR
element of the execution environment\&. One example approach is to extract the entire
\fBPATH\fR
environment variable and set that into the execution environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import os
env = Environment(ENV={\*(AqPATH\*(Aq: os\&.environ[\*(AqPATH\*(Aq]})
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Similarly, if the commands use specific external environment variables that
\fBscons\fR
does not recognize, they can be propagated into the execution environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import os

env = Environment(
    ENV={
        \*(AqPATH\*(Aq: os\&.environ[\*(AqPATH\*(Aq],
        \*(AqANDROID_HOME\*(Aq: os\&.environ[\*(AqANDROID_HOME\*(Aq],
        \*(AqANDROID_NDK_HOME\*(Aq: os\&.environ[\*(AqANDROID_NDK_HOME\*(Aq],
    }
)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Or you may explicitly propagate the invoking user\*(Aqs complete external environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import os
env = Environment(ENV=os\&.environ\&.copy())
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This comes at the expense of making your build dependent on the user\*(Aqs environment being set correctly, but it may be more convenient for many configurations\&. It should not cause problems if done in a build setup which tightly controls how the environment is set up before invoking
\fBscons\fR, as in many continuous integration setups\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
is normally executed in a top\-level directory containing an
SConstruct
file\&. When
\fBscons\fR
is invoked, the command line (including the contents of the
\fBSCONSFLAGS\fR
environment variable, if set) is processed\&. Command\-line options (see
the section called \(lqOPTIONS\(rq) are consumed\&. Any variable argument assignments are collected, and remaining arguments are taken as targets to build\&.
.PP
Values of variables to be passed to the
SConscript
files may be specified on the command line:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons debug=1\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
These variables are available through the
\fIARGUMENTS\fR
dictionary, and can be used in the
SConscript
files to modify the build in any way:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
if ARGUMENTS\&.get(\*(Aqdebug\*(Aq, 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS=\*(Aq\-g\*(Aq)
else:
    env = Environment()
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The command\-line variable arguments are also available in the
\fIARGLIST\fR
list, indexed by their order on the command line\&. This allows you to process them in order rather than by name, if necessary\&. Each
\fIARGLIST\fR
entry is a tuple containing (\fIargname\fR,
\fIargvalue\fR)\&.
.PP
See
the section called \(lqCommand-Line Construction Variables\(rq
for more information\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can be shared between multiple builds\&. When derived\-file caching is enabled in an
SConscript
file, any target files built by
\fBscons\fR
will be copied to the cache\&. If an up\-to\-date target file is found in the cache, it will be retrieved from the cache instead of being rebuilt locally\&. Caching behavior may be disabled and controlled in other ways by the
\fB\-\-cache\-force\fR,
\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR,
\fB\-\-cache\-readonly\fR, and
\fB\-\-cache\-show\fR
command\-line options\&. The
\fB\-\-random\fR
option is useful to prevent multiple builds from trying to update the cache simultaneously\&.
.PP
By default,
\fBscons\fR
searches for known programming tools on various systems and initializes itself based on what is found\&. On Windows systems which identify as
\fIwin32\fR,
\fBscons\fR
searches in order for the Microsoft Visual C++ tools, the MinGW tool chain, the Intel compiler tools, and the PharLap ETS compiler\&. On Windows system which identify as
\fIcygwin\fR
(that is, if
\fBscons\fR
is invoked from a cygwin shell), the order changes to prefer the GCC toolchain over the MSVC tools\&. On OS/2 systems,
\fBscons\fR
searches in order for the OS/2 compiler, the GCC tool chain, and the Microsoft Visual C++ tools, On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX, Hewlett Packard HP\-UX, and Oracle Solaris systems,
\fBscons\fR
searches for the native compiler tools (MIPSpro, Visual Age, aCC, and Forte tools respectively) and the GCC tool chain\&. On all other platforms, including POSIX (Linux and UNIX) platforms,
\fBscons\fR
searches in order for the GCC tool chain, and the Intel compiler tools\&. These default values may be overridden by appropriate setting of
construction variables\&.
.SS "Target Selection"
.PP
SCons
acts on the
selected targets, whether the requested operation is build, no\-exec or clean\&. Targets are selected as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
Targets specified on the command line\&. These may be files, directories, or phony targets defined using the
\fBAlias\fR
function\&. Directory targets are scanned by
\fBscons\fR
for any targets that may be found with a destination in or under that directory\&. The targets listed on the command line are made available in the
\fICOMMAND_LINE_TARGETS\fR
list\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
If no targets are specified on the command line,
\fBscons\fR
will select those targets specified in the
SConscript
files via calls to the
\fBDefault\fR
function\&. These are known as the
default targets, and are made available in the
\fIDEFAULT_TARGETS\fR
list\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  3." 4.2
.\}
If no targets are selected by the previous steps,
\fBscons\fR
selects the current directory for scanning, unless command\-line options which affect the directory for target scanning are present (\fB\-C\fR,
\fB\-D\fR,
\fB\-u\fR,
\fB\-U\fR)\&. Since targets thus selected were not the result of user instructions, this target list is not made available for direct inspection; use the
\fB\-\-debug=explain\fR
option if they need to be examined\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 4.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  4." 4.2
.\}

\fBscons\fR
always adds to the selected targets any intermediate targets which are necessary to build the specified ones\&. For example, if constructing a shared library or dll from C source files,
\fBscons\fR
will also build the object files which will make up the library\&.
.RE
.PP
To ignore the default targets specified through calls to
\fBDefault\fR
and instead build all target files in or below the current directory specify the current directory (\&.) as a command\-line target:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons \&.\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To build all target files, including any files outside of the current directory, supply a command\-line target of the root directory (on POSIX systems):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons /\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets should be built (on Windows systems):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons C:\e D:\e\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by remaining at the top\-level directory (where the
SConstruct
file lives) and specifying the subdirectory as the target to build:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons src/subdir\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or by changing directory and invoking scons with the
\fB\-u\fR
option, which traverses up the directory hierarchy until it finds the
SConstruct
file, and then builds targets relatively to the current subdirectory (see also the related
\fB\-D\fR
and
\fB\-U\fR
options):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBcd src/subdir\fR
\fBscons \-u \&.\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
In all cases, more files may be built than are requested, as
\fBscons\fR
needs to make sure any dependent files are built\&.
.PP
Specifying "cleanup" targets in
SConscript
files is usually not necessary\&. The
\fB\-c\fR
flag removes all selected targets:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons \-c \&.\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
to remove all target files in or under the current directory, or:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons \-c build export\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
to remove target files under
build
and
export\&.
.PP
Additional files or directories to remove can be specified using the
\fBClean\fR
function in the
SConscript
files\&. Conversely, targets that would normally be removed by the
\fB\-c\fR
invocation can be retained by calling the
\fBNoClean\fR
function with those targets\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
supports building multiple targets in parallel via a
\fB\-j\fR
option that takes, as its argument, the number of simultaneous tasks that may be spawned:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons \-j 4\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
builds four targets in parallel, for example\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
In general,
\fBscons\fR
supports the same command\-line options as GNU
Make
and many of those supported by
cons\&.
.PP
\fB\-b\fR
.RS 4
Ignored for compatibility with non\-GNU versions of
Make
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR, \fB\-\-remove\fR
.RS 4
Set
clean
mode\&. Clean up by removing the selected targets, well as any files or directories associated with a selected target through calls to the
\fBClean\fR
function\&. Will not remove any targets which are marked for preservation through calls to the
\fBNoClean\fR
function\&.
.sp
While clean mode removes targets rather than building them, work which is done directly in
Python
code in
SConscript
files will still be carried out\&. If it is important to avoid some such work from taking place in clean mode, it should be protected\&. An
SConscript
file can determine which mode is active by querying
\fBGetOption\fR, as in the call
if GetOption("clean"):
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cache\-debug=\fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.RS 4
Write debug information about derived\-file caching to the specified
\fIfile\fR\&. If
\fIfile\fR
is a hyphen (\-), the debug information is printed to the standard output\&. The printed messages describe what signature\-file names are being looked for in, retrieved from, or written to the derived\-file cache specified by
\fBCacheDir\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR, \fB\-\-no\-cache\fR
.RS 4
Disable derived\-file caching\&.
\fBscons\fR
will neither retrieve files from the cache nor copy files to the cache\&. This option can be used to temporarily disable the cache without modifying the build scripts\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cache\-force\fR, \fB\-\-cache\-populate\fR
.RS 4
When using
\fBCacheDir\fR, populate a derived\-file cache by copying any already\-existing, up\-to\-date derived files to the cache, in addition to files built by this invocation\&. This is useful to populate a new cache with all the current derived files, or to add to the cache any derived files recently built with caching disabled via the
\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cache\-readonly\fR
.RS 4
Use the derived\-file cache, if enabled, to retrieve files, but do not not update the cache with any files actually built during this invocation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cache\-show\fR
.RS 4
When using a derived\-file cache show the command that would have been executed to build the file (or the corresponding
*COMSTR
contents if set) even if the file is retrieved from cache\&. Without this option,
\fBscons\fR
shows a cache retrieval message if the file is fetched from cache\&. This allows producing consistent output for build logs, regardless of whether a target file was rebuilt or retrieved from the cache\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-config=\fR\fB\fImode\fR\fR
.RS 4
Control how the
\fBConfigure\fR
call should use or generate the results of configuration tests\&.
\fImode\fR
should be one of the following choices:
.PP
\fBauto\fR
.RS 4
SCons
will use its normal dependency mechanisms to decide if a test must be rebuilt or not\&. This saves time by not running the same configuration tests every time you invoke scons, but will overlook changes in system header files or external commands (such as compilers) if you don\*(Aqt specify those dependecies explicitly\&. This is the default behavior\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBforce\fR
.RS 4
If this mode is specified, all configuration tests will be re\-run regardless of whether the cached results are out of date\&. This can be used to explicitly force the configuration tests to be updated in response to an otherwise unconfigured change in a system header file or compiler\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcache\fR
.RS 4
If this mode is specified, no configuration tests will be rerun and all results will be taken from cache\&.
\fBscons\fR
will report an error if
\fB\-\-config=cache\fR
is specified and a necessary test does not have any results in the cache\&.
.RE
.sp

or
sconstruct\&.py
file or doing anything else\&. When multiple
\fB\-C\fR

\fB\-C\fR
\fIdirectory\fR
is interpreted relative to the preceding one\&. This option is similar to using
\fB\-f \fR\fB\fIdirectory\fR\fR\fB/SConstruct\fR, but
\fB\-f\fR
does not search for any of the predefined
SConstruct

.SH "SCONSCRIPT FILE REFERENCE"

.PP
The build configuration is described by one or more files, known as
SConscript
files\&. There must be at least one file for a valid build (\fBscons\fR
will quit if it does not find one)\&.
\fBscons\fR
by default looks for this file by the name
SConstruct
in the directory from which you run
\fBscons\fR, though if necessary, also looks for alternative file names
Sconstruct,
sconstruct,
SConstruct\&.py,
Sconstruct\&.py
and
sconstruct\&.py
in that order\&. A different file name (which can include a pathname part) may be specified via the
\fB\-f\fR
option\&. Except for the SConstruct file, these files are not searched for automatically; you add additional configuration files to the build by calling the
\fBSConscript\fR
function\&. This allows parts of the build to be conditionally included or excluded at run\-time depending on how
\fBscons\fR
is invoked\&.
.PP
Each
SConscript
file in a build configuration is invoked independently in a separate context\&. This provides necessary isolation so that different parts of the build don\*(Aqt accidentally step on each other\&. You have to be explicit about sharing information, by using the
\fBExport\fR
function or the
\fIexports\fR
argument to the
\fBSConscript\fR
function, as well as the
\fBReturn\fR
function in a called
SConscript

.SS "Construction Environments"
.PP
A
Construction Environment
is the basic means by which you communicate build information to
SCons\&. A new
construction environment
is created using the
\fBEnvironment\fR
function:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment()
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Construction environment
attributes called
Construction Variables
may be set either by specifying them as keyword arguments when the object is created or by assigning them a value after the object is created\&. These two are nominally equivalent:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(FOO=\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq)
env[\*(AqFOO\*(Aq] = \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that certain settings which affect tool detection are referenced only when the tools are initializided, so you either need either to supply them as part of the call to
\fBEnvironment\fR, or defer tool initialization\&. For example, initializing the Microsoft Visual C++ version you wish to use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# initializes msvc to v14\&.1
env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION="14\&.1")

env = Environment()
# msvc tool was initialized to default, does not reinitialize
env[\*(AqMSVC_VERSION\*(Aq] = "14\&.1"

env = Environment(tools=[])
env[\*(AqMSVC_VERSION\*(Aq] = "14\&.1"
# msvc tool initialization was deferred, so will pick up new value
env\&.Tool(\*(Aqdefault\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
As a convenience,
construction variables
may also be set or modified by the
\fIparse_flags\fR
keyword argument during object creation, which has the effect of the
\fBenv\&.MergeFlags\fR
method being applied to the argument value after all other processing is completed\&. This is useful either if the exact content of the flags is unknown (for example, read from a control file) or if the flags need to be distributed to a number of
construction variables\&.
\fBenv\&.ParseFlags\fR
describes how these arguments are distributed to
construction variables\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(parse_flags=\*(Aq\-Iinclude \-DEBUG \-lm\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This example adds \*(Aqinclude\*(Aq to the
\fB$CPPPATH\fR
construction variable, \*(AqEBUG\*(Aq to
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR, and \*(Aqm\*(Aq to
\fB$LIBS\fR\&.
.PP
An existing
construction environment
can be duplicated by calling the
\fBenv\&.Clone\fR
method\&. Without arguments, it will be a copy with the same settings\&. Otherwise,
\fBenv\&.Clone\fR
takes the same arguments as
\fBEnvironment\fR, and uses the arguments to create a modified copy\&.
.PP

SCons
provides a special
construction environment
called the
Default Environment\&. The
default environment
is used only for global functions, that is, construction activities called without the context of a regular
construction environment\&. See
\fBDefaultEnvironment\fR
for more information\&.
.PP
By default, a new
construction environment
is initialized with a set of builder methods and
construction variables
that are appropriate for the current platform\&. The optional
\fIplatform\fR
keyword argument may be used to specify that the
construction environment
should be initialized for a different platform:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(platform=\*(Aqcygwin\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate
construction variables
in the environment to use and generate file names with prefixes and suffixes appropriate for that platform\&.
.PP
Note that the
win32
platform adds the
\fISystemDrive\fR
and
\fISystemRoot\fR
variables from the user\*(Aqs external environment to the
construction environment\*(Aqs
\fIENV\fR
dictionary\&. This is so that any executed commands that use sockets to connect with other systems will work on Windows systems\&.
.PP
The
\fIplatform\fR
argument may be a string value representing one of the pre\-defined platforms (aix,
cygwin,
darwin,
hpux,
irix,
os2,
posix,
sunos
or
win32), or it may be be a callable platform object returned by a call to
\fBPlatform\fR
selecting a pre\-defined platform, or it may be a user\-supplied callable, in which case the
\fBEnvironment\fR
method will call it to update the new
construction environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def my_platform(env):
    env[\*(AqVAR\*(Aq] = \*(Aqxyzzy\*(Aq

env = Environment(platform=my_platform)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that supplying a non\-default platform or custom fuction for initialization may bypass settings that should happen for the host system and should be used with care\&. It is most useful in the case where the platform is an alternative for the one that would be auto\-detected, such as
platform="cygwin"
on a system which would otherwise identify as
win32\&.
.PP
The optional
\fItools\fR
and
\fItoolpath\fR
keyword arguments affect the way tools available to the environment are initialized\&. See
the section called \(lqTools\(rq
for details\&.
.PP
The optional
\fIvariables\fR
keyword argument allows passing a Variables object which will be used in the initialization of the
construction environment
See
the section called \(lqCommand-Line Construction Variables\(rq
for details\&.
.SS "Tools"
.PP

SCons
has a large number of predefined tool modules (more properly,
tool specification modules) which are used to help initialize the
construction environment\&. An
SCons
tool is only responsible for setup\&. For example, if an
SConscript
file declares the need to construct an object file from a C\-language source file by calling the
\fBObject\fR
builder, then a tool representing an available C compiler needs to have run first, to set up that builder and all the
construction variables
it needs in the associated
construction environment; the tool itself is not called in the process of the build\&. Normally this happens invisibly as
\fBscons\fR
has per\-platform lists of default tools, and it steps through those tools, calling the ones which are actually applicable, skipping those where necessary programs are not installed on the build system, or other preconditions are not met\&.
.PP
A specific set of tools with which to initialize an environment when creating it may be specified using the optional keyword argument
\fItools\fR, which takes a list of tool names\&. This is useful to override the defaults, to specify non\-default built\-in tools, and to supply added tools:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqmsvc\*(Aq, \*(Aqlex\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Tools can also be directly called by using the
\fBTool\fR
method (see below)\&.
.PP
The
\fItools\fR
argument overrides the default tool list, it does not add to it, so be sure to include all the tools you need\&. For example if you are building a c/c++ program you must specify a tool for at least a compiler and a linker, as in
tools=[\*(Aqclang\*(Aq, \*(Aqlink\*(Aq]\&. The tool name
\*(Aqdefault\*(Aq
can be used to retain the default list\&.
.PP
If no
\fItools\fR
argument is specified, or if
\fItools\fR
includes
\*(Aqdefault\*(Aq, then
\fBscons\fR
will auto\-detect usable tools, using the execution environment value of
\fIPATH\fR
(that is,
\fI\fIenv\fR\fR\fI[\*(AqENV\*(Aq][\*(AqPATH\*(Aq]\fR
\- the external evironment
\fBPATH\fR
from
\fIos\&.environ\fR
is
\fInot\fR
used) for looking up any backing programs, and the platform name in effect to determine the default tools for that platform\&. Changing the
\fIPATH\fR
variable after the
construction environment
is constructed will not cause the tools to be re\-detected\&.

Additional tools can be added, see the

docbook
.RS 4
This tool tries to make working with Docbook in SCons a little easier\&. It provides several toolchains for creating different output formats, like HTML or PDF\&. Contained in the package is a distribution of the Docbook XSL stylesheets as of version 1\&.76\&.1\&. As long as you don\*(Aqt specify your own stylesheets for customization, these official versions are picked as default\&.\&.\&.which should reduce the inevitable setup hassles for you\&.
.sp
Implicit dependencies to images and XIncludes are detected automatically if you meet the HTML requirements\&. The additional stylesheet
utils/xmldepend\&.xsl
by Paul DuBois is used for this purpose\&.
.sp
Note, that there is no support for XML catalog resolving offered! This tool calls the XSLT processors and PDF renderers with the stylesheets you specified, that\*(Aqs it\&. The rest lies in your hands and you still have to know what you\*(Aqre doing when resolving names via a catalog\&.
.sp
For activating the tool "docbook", you have to add its name to the Environment constructor, like this
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
On its startup, the
docbook
tool tries to find a required
xsltproc
processor, and a PDF renderer, e\&.g\&.
fop\&. So make sure that these are added to your system\*(Aqs environment
\fBPATH\fR
and can be called directly without specifying their full path\&.
.sp
For the most basic processing of Docbook to HTML, you need to have installed
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.el \{\

.RE
.sp
Rendering to PDF requires you to have one of the applications
fop

installed\&.
.sp
Creating a HTML or PDF document is very simple and straightforward\&. Say
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
env\&.DocbookHtml(\*(Aqmanual\&.html\*(Aq, \*(Aqmanual\&.xml\*(Aq)
env\&.DocbookPdf(\*(Aqmanual\&.pdf\*(Aq, \*(Aqmanual\&.xml\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
to get both outputs from your XML source
manual\&.xml\&. As a shortcut, you can give the stem of the filenames alone, like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
env\&.DocbookHtml(\*(Aqmanual\*(Aq)
env\&.DocbookPdf(\*(Aqmanual\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
and get the same result\&. Target and source lists are also supported:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
env\&.DocbookHtml([\*(Aqmanual\&.html\*(Aq,\*(Aqreference\&.html\*(Aq], [\*(Aqmanual\&.xml\*(Aq,\*(Aqreference\&.xml\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
or even

Whenever you leave out the list of sources, you may not specify a file extension! The Tool uses the given names as file stems, and adds the suffixes for target and source files accordingly\&.
.sp .5v

The rules given above are valid for the Builders
\fBDocbookHtml\fR,
\fBDocbookPdf\fR,
\fBDocbookEpub\fR,
\fBDocbookSlidesPdf\fR
and
\fBDocbookXInclude\fR\&. For the
\fBDocbookMan\fR
transformation you can specify a target name, but the actual output names are automatically set from the
refname
entries in your XML source\&.
.sp
The Builders
\fBDocbookHtmlChunked\fR,
\fBDocbookHtmlhelp\fR
and
\fBDocbookSlidesHtml\fR
are special, in that:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2

they create a large set of files, where the exact names and their number depend on the content of the source file, and
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
the main target is always named
index\&.html, i\&.e\&. the output name for the XSL transformation is not picked up by the stylesheets\&.
.RE
.sp
As a result, there is simply no use in specifying a target HTML name\&. So the basic syntax for these builders is always:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
env\&.DocbookHtmlhelp(\*(Aqmanual\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If you want to use a specific XSL file, you can set the additional
\fIxsl\fR
parameter to your Builder call as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.DocbookHtml(\*(Aqother\&.html\*(Aq, \*(Aqmanual\&.xml\*(Aq, xsl=\*(Aqhtml\&.xsl\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Since this may get tedious if you always use the same local naming for your customized XSL files, e\&.g\&.
html\&.xsl
for HTML and
pdf\&.xsl
for PDF output, a set of variables for setting the default XSL name is provided\&. These are:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLCHUNKED
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLHELP
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_PDF

DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_MAN
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESPDF
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESHTML
.fi
.if n \{\

and you can set them when constructing your environment:

.nf
env = Environment(

\fBAutomatic moc file generation from header files\&.\fR
You do not have to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you\&. However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header file must have the same filebase as your implementation file and must stay in the same directory\&. It must have one of the suffixes
\&.h,
\&.hpp,
\&.H,
\&.hxx,
\&.hh\&. You can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting

.sp

\fBAutomatic moc file generation from C++ files\&.\fR

${QT3_MOCCXXPREFIX}<basename>${QT3_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default
<basename>\&.mo\&. A warning is generated after building the moc file if you do not include the correct file\&. If you are using
\fBVariantDir\fR, you may need to specify
\fIduplicate=True\fR\&. You can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting

.SS "Builder Methods"
.PP
You tell
SCons
what to build by calling
Builders, functions which take particular action(s) to produce target(s) of a particular type (conventionally hinted at by the builder name, e\&.g\&.
\fBProgram\fR) from the specified source files\&. A builder call is a declaration:
SCons
enters the specified relationship into its internal dependency node graph, and only later makes the decision on whether anything is actually built, since this depends on command\-line options, target selection rules, and whether the target(s) are out of date with respect to the sources\&.
.PP

SCons
provides a number of builders, and you can also write your own (see
Builder Objects)\&. Builders are created dynamically at run\-time, often (though not always) by tools which determine whether the external dependencies for the builder are satisfied, and which perform the necessary setup (see
Tools)\&. Builders are attached to a
construction environment
as methods\&. The available builder methods are registered as key\-value pairs in the
\fB$BUILDERS\fR
attribute of the
construction environment, so the available builders can be examined\&. This example displays them for debugging purposes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment()
print("Builders:", list(env[\*(AqBUILDERS\*(Aq]))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Builder methods take two required arguments:
\fItarget\fR
and
\fIsource\fR\&. The
\fItarget\fR
and
\fIsource\fR
arguments can be specified either as positional arguments, in which case
\fItarget\fR
comes first, or as keyword arguments, using
\fItarget=\fR
and
\fIsource=\fR\&. Although both arguments are nominally required, if there is a single source and the target can be inferred the
\fItarget\fR
argument can be omitted (see below)\&. Builder methods also take a variety of keyword arguments, described below\&.
.PP
Because long lists of file names can lead to a lot of quoting in a builder call,
SCons
supplies a
\fBSplit\fR
global function and a same\-named environment method that splits a single string into a list, using strings of white\-space characters as the delimiter (similar to the
Python
string
\fBsplit\fR
method, but succeeds even if the input isn\*(Aqt a string)\&.
.PP
The following are equivalent examples of calling the
\fBProgram\fR
builder method:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, [\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq])
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, env\&.Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(source=[\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq], target=\*(Aqbar\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(target=\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source=Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(target=\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source=env\&.Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source=\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq\&.split())
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Sources and targets can be specified as a scalar or as a list, composed of either strings or nodes (more on nodes below)\&. When specifying path strings,
Python
follows the POSIX pathname convention: if a string begins with the operating system pathname separator (on Windows both the slash and backslash separator are accepted, and any leading drive specifier is ignored for the determination) it is considered an absolute path, otherwise it is a relative path\&. If the path string contains no separator characters, it is searched for as a file in the current directory\&. If it contains separator characters, the search follows down from the starting point, which is the top of the directory tree for an absolute path and the current directory for a relative path\&. The "current directory" in this context is the directory of the
SConscript
file currently being processed\&.
.PP

SCons
also recognizes a third way to specify path strings: if the string begins with the
\fB#\fR
character it is
top\-relative
\- it works like a relative path but the search follows down from the directory containing the top\-level
SConstruct
rather than from the current directory\&. The
\fB#\fR
can optionally be followed by a pathname separator, which is ignored if found in that position\&. Top\-relative paths only work in places where
\fBscons\fR
will interpret the path (see some examples below)\&. To be used in other contexts the string will need to be converted to a relative or absolute path first\&.
.PP
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# The comments describing the targets that will be built
# assume these calls are in a SConscript file in the

# Builds the program "/tmp/bar" from "subdir/bar\&.c":
env\&.Program(\*(Aq/tmp/bar\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)

# An initial \*(Aq#\*(Aq or \*(Aq#/\*(Aq are equivalent; the following

env\&.Program(\*(Aq#foo\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(\*(Aq#/bar\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)

# Builds the program "other/foo" (relative to the top\-level

env\&.Program(\*(Aq#other/foo\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)

    env\&.Append(CPPPATH=\*(Aq#inc\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
When the target shares the same base name as the source and only the suffix varies, and if the builder method has a suffix defined for the target file type, then the target argument may be omitted completely, and
\fBscons\fR
will deduce the target file name from the source file name\&. The following examples all build the executable program
\fBbar\fR
(on POSIX systems) or
\fBbar\&.exe\fR
(on Windows systems) from the
bar\&.c
source file:
.sp
.if n \{\

env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.PP
The optional
\fIsrcdir\fR
keyword argument specifies that all source file strings that are not absolute paths or top\-relative paths shall be interpreted relative to the specified
\fIsrcdir\fR\&. The following example will build the
build/prog
(or
build/prog\&.exe
on Windows) program from the files
src/f1\&.c

.sp

The optional
\fIparse_flags\fR

.PP
The optional
\fIchdir\fR
keyword argument specifies that the Builder\*(Aqs action(s) should be executed after changing directory\&. If the
\fIchdir\fR
argument is a path string or a directory Node, scons will change to the specified directory\&. If the

Python

Note that
SCons
will
\fInot\fR
automatically modify its expansion of
construction variables
like
\fB$TARGET\fR
and
\fB$SOURCE\fR
when using the
\fIchdir\fR
keyword argument\-\-that is, the expanded file names will still be relative to the top\-level directory where the
SConstruct
was found, and consequently incorrect relative to the chdir directory\&. If you use the
\fIchdir\fR
keyword argument, you will typically need to supply a different command line using expansions like
${TARGET\&.file}
and
${SOURCE\&.file}
to use just the filename portion of the target and source\&.
.PP
Keyword arguments that are not specifically recognized are treated as
construction variable
overrides, which replace or add those variables on a limited basis\&. These overrides will only be in effect when building the target of the builder call, and will not affect other parts of the build\&. For example, if you want to specify some libraries needed by just one program:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Program(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq, \*(Aqhello\&.c\*(Aq, LIBS=[\*(Aqgl\*(Aq, \*(Aqglut\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or generate a shared library with a non\-standard suffix:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.SharedLibrary(
    target=\*(Aqword\*(Aq,
    source=\*(Aqword\&.cpp\*(Aq,
    SHLIBSUFFIX=\*(Aq\&.ocx\*(Aq,
    LIBSUFFIXES=[\*(Aq\&.ocx\*(Aq],
)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that both the
\fB$SHLIBSUFFIX\fR
and
\fB$LIBSUFFIXES\fR
construction variables
must be set if you want
\fBscons\fR
to search automatically for dependencies on the non\-standard library names; see the descriptions of these variables for more information\&.
.PP
Although the builder methods defined by
\fBscons\fR
are, in fact, methods of a
construction environment
object, many may also be called without an explicit environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Program(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq, \*(Aqhello\&.c\*(Aq)
SharedLibrary(\*(Aqword\*(Aq, \*(Aqword\&.cpp\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
If called this way, the builder will internally use the
Default Environment
that consists of the tools and values that
\fBscons\fR
has determined are appropriate for the local system\&.
.PP
Builder methods that can be called without an explicit environment (indicated in the listing of builders below without a leading
\fIenv\&.\fR) may be called from custom
Python
modules that you import into an
SConscript
file by adding the following to the
Python
module:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
from SCons\&.Script import *
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
A builder
\fImay\fR
add additional targets beyond those requested if an attached
Emitter
chooses to do so (see
the section called \(lqBuilder Objects\(rq
for more information\&.
\fB$PROGEMITTER\fR
is an example)\&. For example, the GNU linker takes a command\-line argument
\fB\-Map=\fR\fB\fImapfile\fR\fR, which causes it to produce a linker map file in addition to the executable file actually being linked\&. If the
\fBProgram\fR
builder\*(Aqs emitter is configured to add this mapfile if the option is set, then two targets will be returned when you only provided for one\&.
.PP
For this reason, builder methods always return a
NodeList, a list\-like object whose elements are Nodes\&. Nodes are the internal representation of build targets or sources (see
the section called \(lqNode Objects\(rq
for more information)\&. The returned
NodeList
object can be passed to other builder methods as source(s) or to other
SCons
functions or methods where a path string would normally be accepted\&.
.PP
For example, to add a specific preprocessor define when compiling one specific object file but not the others:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
bar_obj_list = env\&.StaticObject(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, CPPDEFINES=\*(Aq\-DBAR\*(Aq)
env\&.Program("prog", [\*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq, bar_obj_list, \*(Aqmain\&.c\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Using a Node as in this example makes for a more portable build by avoiding having to specify a platform\-specific object suffix when calling the
\fBProgram\fR
builder method\&.
.PP
The
NodeList
object is also convenient to pass to the
\fBDefault\fR
function, for the same reason of avoiding a platform\-specific name:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
tgt = env\&.Program("prog", ["foo\&.c", "bar\&.c", "main\&.c"])
Default(tgt)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Builder calls will automatically "flatten" lists passed as source and target, so they are free to contain elements which are themselves lists, such as
\fIbar_obj_list\fR
returned by the
\fBStaticObject\fR
call\&. If you need to manipulate a list of lists returned by builders directly in
Python
code, you can either build a new list by hand:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
foo = Object(\*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
bar = Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
objects = [\*(Aqbegin\&.o\*(Aq] + foo + [\*(Aqmiddle\&.o\*(Aq] + bar + [\*(Aqend\&.o\*(Aq]
for obj in objects:
    print(str(obj))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Or you can use the
\fBFlatten\fR
function supplied by
SCons
to create a list containing just the Nodes, which may be more convenient:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
foo = Object(\*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
bar = Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
objects = Flatten([\*(Aqbegin\&.o\*(Aq, foo, \*(Aqmiddle\&.o\*(Aq, bar, \*(Aqend\&.o\*(Aq])
for obj in objects:
    print(str(obj))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Since builder calls return a list\-like object, not an actual
Python
list, it is not appropriate to use the
Python
add operator (+
or
+=) to append builder results to a
Python
list\&. Because the list and the object are different types,
Python
will not update the original list in place, but will instead create a new
NodeList
object containing the concatenation of the list elements and the builder results\&. This will cause problems for any other
Python
variables in your SCons configuration that still hold on to a reference to the original list\&. Instead, use the
Python
list
\fBextend\fR
method to make sure the list is updated in\-place\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
object_files = []

# Do NOT use += here:
#    object_files += Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
#
# It will not update the object_files list in place\&.
#
# Instead, use the list extend method:
object_files\&.extend(Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq))
.fi
.if n \{\

bar_obj_list = env\&.StaticObject(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, CPPDEFINES=\*(Aq\-DBAR\*(Aq)
print("The path to bar_obj is:", str(bar_obj_list[0]))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that because the Builder call returns a
NodeList, you have to access the first element in the list (bar_obj_list[0]
in the example) to get at the Node that actually represents the object file\&.
.PP
When trying to handle errors that may occur in a builder method, consider that the corresponding Action is executed at a different time than the
SConscript
file statement calling the builder\&. It is not useful to wrap a builder call in a
try
block, since success in the builder call is not the same as the builder itself succeeding\&. If necessary, a Builder\*(Aqs Action should be coded to exit with a useful exception message indicating the problem in the
SConscript
files \- programmatically recovering from build errors is rarely useful\&.
.PP
The following builder methods are predefined in the
SCons
core software distribution\&. Depending on the setup of a particular
construction environment
and on the type and software installation status of the underlying system, not all builders may be available in that
construction environment\&. Since the function calling signature is the same for all builders:

The

\fBCompilationDatabase\fR(), \fIenv\fR\&.CompilationDatabase()
.RS 4

\fBCompilationDatabase\fR
is a special builder which adds a target to create a JSON formatted compilation database compatible with
clang
tooling (see the
\m[blue]\fBLLVM specification\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2)\&. This database is suitable for consumption by various tools and editors who can use it to obtain build and dependency information which otherwise would be internal to
SCons\&. The builder does not require any source files to be specified, rather it arranges to emit information about all of the C, C++ and assembler source/output pairs identified in the build that are not excluded by the optional filter
\fB$COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER\fR\&. The target is subject to the usual
SCons
target selection rules\&.
.sp
If called with no arguments, the builder will default to a target name of
compile_commands\&.json\&.
.sp
If called with a single positional argument,
\fBscons\fR
will "deduce" the target name from that source argument, giving it the same name, and then ignore the source\&. This is the usual way to call the builder if a non\-default target name is wanted\&.
.sp
If called with either the
\fItarget=\fR
or
\fIsource=\fR
keyword arguments, the value of the argument is taken as the target name\&. If called with both, the
\fItarget=\fR
value is used and
\fIsource=\fR
is ignored\&. If called with multiple sources, the source list will be ignored, since there is no way to deduce what the intent was; in this case the default target name will be used\&.

\fBMSVSProject\fR(), \fIenv\fR\&.MSVSProject()
.RS 4
Build a Microsoft Visual C++ project file and solution file\&.
.sp
Builds a C++ project file based on the version of Visual Studio (or to be more precise, of MSBuild) that is configured: either the latest installed version, or the version specified by
\fB$MSVC_VERSION\fR
in the current
construction environment\&. For Visual Studio 6\&.0 a
\&.dsp
file is generated\&. For Visual Studio versions 2002\-2008, a
\&.vcproj
file is generated\&. For Visual Studio 2010 and later a
\&.vcxproj
file is generated\&. Note there are multiple versioning schemes involved in the Microsoft compilation environment \- see the description of
\fB$MSVC_VERSION\fR
for equivalences\&.
SCons
does not know how to construct project files for other languages (such as
\&.csproj
for C#,
\&.vbproj
for Visual Basic or
\&.pyproject
for Python))\&.
.sp
For the
\&.vcxproj
file, the underlying format is the MSBuild XML Schema, and the details conform to:
\m[blue]\fBhttps://learn\&.microsoft\&.com/en\-us/cpp/build/reference/vcxproj\-file\-structure\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2\&. The generated solution file enables Visual Studio to understand the project structure, and allows building it using MSBuild to call back to
SCons\&. The project file encodes a toolset version that has been selected by
SCons
as described above\&. Since recent Visual Studio versions support multiple concurrent toolsets, use
\fB$MSVC_VERSION\fR
to select the desired one if it does not match the
SCons
default\&. The project file also includes entries which describe how to call
SCons
to build the project from within Visual Studio (or from an MSBuild command line)\&. In some situations
SCons
may generate this incorrectly \- notably when using the
\fIscons\-local\fR
distribution, which is not installed in a way that that matches the default invocation line\&. If so, the
\fB$SCONS_HOME\fR
construction variable
can be used to describe the right way to locate the
SCons
code so that it can be imported\&.
.sp
By default, a matching solution file for the project is also generated\&. This behavior may be disabled by specifying
\fIauto_build_solution=0\fR
to the
\fBMSVSProject\fR
builder\&. The solution file can also be independently generated by calling the
\fBMSVSSolution\fR
builder, such as in the case where a solution should describe multiple projects\&. See the
\fBMSVSSolution\fR
description for further information\&.
.sp
The
\fBMSVSProject\fR
builder accepts several keyword arguments describing lists of filenames to be placed into the project file\&. Currently,
\fIsrcs\fR,
\fIincs\fR,
\fIlocalincs\fR,
\fIresources\fR, and
\fImisc\fR
are recognized\&. The names are intended to be self\-explanatory, but note that the filenames need to be specified as strings,
\fInot\fR
as
SCons
File Nodes (for example if you generate files for inclusion by using the
\fBGlob\fR
function, the results should be converted to a list of strings before passing them to
\fBMSVSProject\fR)\&. This is because Visual Studio and MSBuild know nothing about
SCons
Node types\&. Each of the filename lists are individually optional, but at least one list must be specified for the resulting project file to be non\-empty\&.
.sp
In addition to the above lists of values, the following values may be specified as keyword arguments:
.PP
\fItarget\fR
.RS 4
The name of the target
\&.dsp
or
\&.vcproj
file\&. The correct suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but the
\fB$MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX\fR
construction variable
will be defined to the correct value (see example below)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIvariant\fR
.RS 4
The name of this particular variant\&. Except for Visual Studio 6 projects, this can also be a list of variant names\&. These are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really can be anything you want\&. For Visual Studio 7 projects, they may also specify a target platform separated from the variant name by a
|
(vertical pipe) character:
Debug|Xbox\&. The default target platform is Win32\&. Multiple calls to
\fBMSVSProject\fR

.RE
.PP
\fIcmdargs\fR
.RS 4

SCons
and Microsoft Visual Studio understand projects in different ways, and the mapping is sometimes imperfect:
.sp
Because
SCons
always executes its build commands from the directory in which the
SConstruct
file is located, if you generate a project file in a different directory than the directory of the
SConstruct
file, users will not be able to double\-click on the file name in compilation error messages displayed in the Visual Studio console output window\&. This can be remedied by adding the Visual C/C++
\fB/FC\fR
compiler option to the
\fB$CCFLAGS\fR
variable so that the compiler will print the full path name of any files that cause compilation errors\&.
.sp
If the project file is only used to teach the Visual Studio project browser about the file layout there should be no issues, However, Visual Studio should not be used to make changes to the project structure, build options, etc\&. as these will (a) not feed back to the
SCons
description of the project and (b) be lost if
SCons
regenerates the project file\&. The SConscript files should remain the definitive description of the build\&.
.sp
If the project file is used to drive MSBuild (such as selecting "build" from the Visual Studio interface) you lose the direct control of target selection and command\-line options you would have if launching the build directly from
SCons, because these will be hardcoded in the project file to the values specified in the
\fBMSVSProject\fR
call\&. You can regain some of this control by defining multiple variants, using multiple
\fBMSVSProject\fR
calls to arrange different build targets, arguments, defines, flags and paths for different variants\&.
.sp
If the build is divided into a solution with multiple MSBuild projects the mapping is further strained\&. In this case, it is important not to set Visual Studio to do parallel builds, as it will then launch the separate project builds in parallel, and
SCons
does not work well if called that way\&. Instead you can set up the
SCons
build for parallel building \- see the
\fBSetOption\fR
function for how to do this with
\fInum_jobs\fR\&.

function\&. Some package\-level tags are mandatory, and will lead to errors if omitted\&. The mandatory tags vary depending on the package type\&.
.sp
While packaging, the builder uses a temporary location named by the value of the
\fB$PACKAGEROOT\fR
variable \- the package sources are copied there before packaging\&.
.sp
Packaging example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=["default", "packaging"])
env\&.Install("/bin/", "my_program")
env\&.Package(
    NAME="foo",
    VERSION="1\&.2\&.3",
    PACKAGEVERSION=0,
    PACKAGETYPE="rpm",
    LICENSE="gpl",
    SUMMARY="balalalalal",
    DESCRIPTION="this should be really really long",
    X_RPM_GROUP="Application/fu",
    SOURCE_URL="https://foo\&.org/foo\-1\&.2\&.3\&.tar\&.gz",
)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In this example, the target
/bin/my_program
created by the
\fBInstall\fR
call would not be built by default since it is not under the project top directory\&. However, since no
\fIsource\fR
is specified to the
\fBPackage\fR
builder, it is selected for packaging by the default sources rule\&. Since packaging is done using
\fB$PACKAGEROOT\fR, no write is actually done to the system\*(Aqs
/bin
directory, and the target
\fIwill\fR
be selected since after rebasing to underneath
\fB$PACKAGEROOT\fR
it is now under the top directory of the project\&.

\fBPCH\fR(), \fIenv\fR\&.PCH()
.RS 4
Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header\&. Calling this builder returns a list of two target nodes: the PCH as the first element, and the object file as the second element\&. Normally the object file is ignored\&. The
\fBPCH\fR
builder is generally used in conjunction with the
\fB$PCH\fR
construction variable
to force object files to use the precompiled header:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env[\*(AqPCH\*(Aq] = env\&.PCH(\*(AqStdAfx\&.cpp\*(Aq)[0]

.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
This builder is specific to the PCH implementation in Microsoft Visual C++\&. Other compiler chains also implement precompiled header support, but
\fBPCH\fR
does not work with them at this time\&. As a result, the builder is only generated into the construction environment when Microsoft Visual C++ is being used as the compiler\&.
.sp
The builder only works correctly in a C++ project\&. The Microsoft implementation distinguishes between precompiled headers from C and C++\&. Use of the builder will cause the PCH generation to happen with a flag that tells
cl\&.exe
all of the files are C++ files; if that PCH file is then supplied when compiling a C source file,
cl\&.exe
will fail the build with a compatibility violation\&.
.sp
If possible, arrange the project so that a C++ source file passed to the
\fBPCH\fR
builder is not also included in the list of sources to be otherwise compiled in the project\&.
SCons
will correctly track that file in the dependency tree as a result of the
\fBPCH\fR
call, and (for MSVC 11\&.0 and greater) automatically add the corresponding object file to the link line\&. If the source list is automatically generated, for example using the
\fBGlob\fR
function, it may be necessary to remove that file from the list\&.

The last approach is perhaps the recommended one\&. It allows easily split internationalization/localization onto separate SCons scripts, where a script in source tree is responsible for translations (from sources to
PO
files) and script(s) under variant directories are responsible for compilation of
PO
to
MO
files to and for installation of
MO
files\&. The "gluing factor" synchronizing these two scripts is then the content of
LINGUAS
file\&. Note, that the updated
POT
and
PO
files are usually going to be committed back to the repository, so they must be updated within the source directory (and not in variant directories)\&. Additionaly, the file listing of
po/
directory contains
LINGUAS
file, so the source tree looks familiar to translators, and they may work with the project in their usual way\&.

All targets of builder methods automatically depend on their sources\&. An explicit dependency can be specified using the
\fBenv\&.Depends\fR
method of a
construction environment
(see below)\&.
.PP
In addition,
\fBscons\fR
automatically scans source files for various programming languages, so the dependencies do not need to be specified explicitly\&. By default, SCons can C source files, C++ source files, Fortran source files with
\&.F
(POSIX systems only),
\&.fpp, or
\&.FPP
file extensions, and assembly language files with
\&.S
(POSIX systems only),
\&.spp, or
\&.SPP
files extensions for C preprocessor dependencies\&. SCons also has default support for scanning D source files, You can also write your own Scanners to add support for additional source file types\&. These can be added to the default Scanner object used by the
\fBObject\fR,
\fBStaticObject\fR
and
\fBSharedObject\fR
Builders by adding them to the
SourceFileScanner

the section called \(lqScanner Objects\(rq
for more information about defining your own Scanner objects and using the
SourceFileScanner
object\&.
.SS "Methods and Functions To Do Things"
.PP
In addition to Builder methods,
\fBscons\fR
provides a number of other
construction environment
methods and global functions to manipulate the build configuration\&.
.PP
Usually, a
construction environment
method and global function with the same name both exist for convenience\&. In the following list, the global function is documented in this style:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBFunction\fR(\fIarguments, [optional arguments]\fR)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
and the
construction environment
method looks like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fIenv\fR\&.Function(\fIarguments, [optional arguments]\fR)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
If the function can be called both ways, then both forms are listed\&.
.PP
The global function and same\-named
construction environment
method provide almost identical functionality, with a couple of exceptions\&. First, many of the
construction environment
methods affect only that
construction environment, while the global function has a global effect\&. Second, where appropriate, calling the functionality through a
construction environment
will substitute
construction variables
into any supplied string arguments, while the global function doesn\*(Aqt have the context of a
construction environment
to pick variables from, so it cannot perform the substitution\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Default(\*(Aq$FOO\*(Aq)

env = Environment(FOO=\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq)
env\&.Default(\*(Aq$FOO\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
In the above example, the call to the global
\fBDefault\fR
function will add a target named
\fB$FOO\fR
to the list of default targets, while the call to the
\fBenv\&.Default\fR
construction environment
method will expand the value and add a target named
\fBfoo\fR
to the list of default targets\&. For more on
construction variable
expansion, see the next section on
construction variables\&.
.PP
Global functions may be called from custom Python modules that you import into an
SConscript
file by adding the following import to the Python module:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
from SCons\&.Script import *
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Construction environment
methods and global functions provided by
\fBscons\fR
include:
.PP
\fBAction\fR(\fIaction, [output, [var, \&.\&.\&.]] [key=value, \&.\&.\&.]\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.Action(\fIaction, [output, [var, \&.\&.\&.]] [key=value, \&.\&.\&.]\fR)
.RS 4
A factory function to create an Action object for the specified
\fIaction\fR\&. See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior\&.
.sp
Note that the
\fBenv\&.Action\fR
form of the invocation will expand construction variables in any argument strings, including the
\fIaction\fR
argument, at the time it is called using the construction variables in the
\fIenv\fR
construction environment through which
\fBenv\&.Action\fR
was called\&. The
\fBAction\fR
global function form delays all variable expansion until the Action object is actually used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBAddMethod\fR(\fIobject, function, [name]\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.AddMethod(\fIfunction, [name]\fR)
.RS 4
Adds
\fIfunction\fR
to an object as a method\&.
\fIfunction\fR
will be called with an instance object as the first argument as for other methods\&. If
\fIname\fR
is given, it is used as the name of the new method, else the name of
\fIfunction\fR
is used\&.
.sp
When the global function
\fBAddMethod\fR
is called, the object to add the method to must be passed as the first argument; typically this will be
\fBEnvironment\fR, in order to create a method which applies to all
construction environments
subsequently constructed\&. When called using the
\fBenv\&.AddMethod\fR
form, the method is added to the specified
construction environment
only\&. Added methods propagate through
\fBenv\&.Clone\fR
calls\&.
.sp
More examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
# Function to add must accept an instance argument\&.
# The Python convention is to call this \*(Aqself\*(Aq\&.
def my_method(self, arg):

AddMethod(Environment, my_method)
env = Environment()
env\&.my_method(\*(Aqarg\*(Aq)

# Use the optional name argument to set the name of the method:

\fBAddOption\fR(\fIarguments\fR)
.RS 4
Adds a local (project\-specific) command\-line option\&.
\fIarguments\fR
are the same as those supported by the
\fBadd_option\fR
method in the standard Python library module
optparse, with a few additional capabilities noted below\&. See the documentation for
optparse
for a thorough discussion of its option\-processing capabities\&.
.sp
In addition to the arguments and values supported by the
optparse
\fBadd_option\fR
method,
\fBAddOption\fR
allows setting the
\fInargs\fR
keyword value to a string consisting of a question mark (\*(Aq?\*(Aq) to indicate that the option argument for that option string is optional\&. If the option string is present on the command line but has no matching option argument, the value of the
\fIconst\fR
keyword argument is produced as the value of the option\&. If the option string is omitted from the command line, the value of the
\fIdefault\fR
keyword argument is produced, as usual; if there is no
\fIdefault\fR
keyword argument in the
\fBAddOption\fR
call,
\fBNone\fR
is produced\&.
.sp

optparse
recognizes abbreviations of long option names, as long as they can be unambiguously resolved\&. For example, if
\fBadd_option\fR
is called to define a
\fB\-\-devicename\fR
option, it will recognize
\fB\-\-device\fR,
\fB\-\-dev\fR
and so forth as long as there is no other option which could also match to the same abbreviation\&. Options added via
\fBAddOption\fR
do not support the automatic recognition of abbreviations\&. Instead, to allow specific abbreviations, include them as synonyms in the
\fBAddOption\fR
call itself\&.
.sp
Once a new command\-line option has been added with
\fBAddOption\fR, the option value may be accessed using
\fBGetOption\fR
or
\fBenv\&.GetOption\fR\&.
\fBSetOption\fR
is not currently supported for options added with
\fBAddOption\fR\&.
.sp
Help text for an option is a combination of the string supplied in the
\fIhelp\fR
keyword argument to
\fBAddOption\fR
and information collected from the other keyword arguments\&. Such help is displayed if the
\fB\-h\fR
command line option is used (but not with
\fB\-H\fR)\&. Help for all local options is displayed under the separate heading
\fBLocal Options\fR\&. The options are unsorted \- they will appear in the help text in the order in which the
\fBAddOption\fR
calls occur\&.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
AddOption(
    \*(Aq\-\-prefix\*(Aq,
    dest=\*(Aqprefix\*(Aq,
    nargs=1,

    help=\*(Aqinstallation prefix\*(Aq,
)
env = Environment(PREFIX=GetOption(\*(Aqprefix\*(Aq))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
For that example, the following help text would be produced:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf

.fi
.if n \{\

As an artifact of the internal implementation, the behavior of options added by
\fBAddOption\fR
which take option arguments is undefined
\fIif\fR
whitespace (rather than an
=
sign) is used as the separator on the command line\&. Users should avoid such usage; it is recommended to add a note to this effect to project documentation if the situation is likely to arise\&. In addition, if the
\fInargs\fR
keyword is used to specify more than one following option argument (that is, with a value of
\fB2\fR
or greater), such arguments would necessarily be whitespace separated, triggering the issue\&. Developers should not use
\fBAddOption\fR
this way\&. Future versions of
SCons
will likely forbid such usage\&.

Creates an

target that can be used as a reference to zero or more other targets, specified by the optional
\fIsource\fR
parameter\&. Aliases provide a way to give a shorter or more descriptive name to specific targets, and to group multiple targets under a single name\&. The alias name, or an Alias Node object, may be used as a dependency of any other target, including another alias\&.
.sp

\fIalias\fR
and
\fIsource\fR
may each be a string or Node object, or a list of strings or Node objects; if Nodes are used for
\fIalias\fR
they must be Alias nodes\&. If
\fIsource\fR
is omitted, the alias is created but has no reference; if selected for building this will result in a
\(lqNothing to be done\&.\(rq
message\&. An empty alias can be used to define the alias in a visible place in the project; it can later be appended to in a subsidiary SConscript file with the actual target(s) to refer to\&. The optional
\fIaction\fR
parameter specifies an action or list of actions that will be executed whenever the any of the alias targets are out\-of\-date\&.
.sp

\fBAlias\fR
can be called for an existing alias, which appends the
\fIalias\fR
and/or
\fIaction\fR
arguments to the existing lists for that alias\&.
.sp
Returns a list of Alias Node objects representing the alias(es), which exist outside of any physical file system\&. The alias name space is separate from the name space for tangible targets; to avoid confusion do not reuse target names as alias names\&.

Appends value(s) intelligently to

construction variables
and values to add to them are passed as
\fIkey=val\fR
pairs (Python
keyword arguments)\&.
\fBenv\&.Append\fR
is designed to allow adding values without having to think about the data type of an existing
construction variable\&. Regular
Python
syntax can also be used to manipulate the
construction variable, but for that you may need to know the types involved, for example pure
Python
lets you directly "add" two lists of strings, but adding a string to a list or a list to a string requires different syntax \- things
\fBAppend\fR
takes care of\&. Some pre\-defined
construction variables
do have type expectations based on how
SCons
will use them: for example
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR
is often a string or a list of strings, but can also be a list of tuples or a dictionary; while
\fB$LIBEMITTER\fR
is expected to be a callable or list of callables, and
\fB$BUILDERS\fR
is expected to be a dictionary\&. Consult the documentation for the various
construction variables
for more details\&.
.sp
The following descriptions apply to both the
\fBAppend\fR
and
\fBPrepend\fR
methods, as well as their
\fBUnique\fR
variants, with the differences being the insertion point of the added values and whether duplication is allowed\&.
.sp

\fIval\fR
can be almost any type\&. If
\fIenv\fR
does not have a
construction variable
named
\fIkey\fR, then
\fIkey\fR
is simply stored with a value of
\fIval\fR\&. Otherwise,
\fIval\fR
is combinined with the existing value, possibly converting into an appropriate type which can hold the expanded contents\&. There are a few special cases to be aware of\&. Normally, when two strings are combined, the result is a new string containing their concatenation (and you are responsible for supplying any needed separation); however, the contents of
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR
will will be postprocessed by adding a prefix and/or suffix to each entry when the command line is produced, so
SCons
keeps them separate \- appending a string will result in a separate string entry, not a combined string\&. For
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR\&. as well as
\fB$LIBS\fR, and the various
*PATH
variables,
SCons
will amend the variable by supplying the compiler\-specific syntax (e\&.g\&. prepending a
\-D
or
/D
prefix for
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR), so you should omit this syntax when adding values to these variables\&. Examples (gcc syntax shown in the expansion of
\fICPPDEFINES\fR):

Because

is intended for command\-line specification of C/C++ preprocessor macros, additional syntax is accepted when adding to it\&. The preprocessor accepts arguments to predefine a macro name by itself (\-DFOO

Appending a string

construction variable
enters
\fIval\fR
as the key in the dictionary, and
None
as its value\&. Using a tuple type to supply a
key, value
only works for the special case of
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR
described above\&.
.sp
Although most combinations of types work without needing to know the details, some combinations do not make sense and
Python
raises an exception\&.
.sp
When using
\fBenv\&.Append\fR
to modify
construction variables
which are path specifications (conventionally, the names of such end in
PATH), it is recommended to add the values as a list of strings, even if you are only adding a single string\&. The same goes for adding library names to

\fIaction\fR
argument, at the time it is called using the construction variables in the

Direct
\fBscons\fR
to maintain a derived\-file cache in
\fIcache_dir\fR\&. The derived files in the cache will be shared among all the builds specifying the same
\fIcache_dir\fR\&. Specifying a
\fIcache_dir\fR
of
\fBNone\fR
disables derived file caching\&.
.sp
Calling the environment method
\fBenv\&.CacheDir\fR
limits the effect to targets built through the specified construction environment\&. Calling the global function
\fBCacheDir\fR
sets a global default that will be used by all targets built through construction environments that do not set up environment\-specific caching by calling
\fBenv\&.CacheDir\fR\&.
.sp
Caching behavior can be configured by passing a specialized cache class as the optional
\fIcustom_class\fR
parameter\&. This class must be a subclass of
SCons\&.CacheDir\&.CacheDir\&.
SCons
will internally invoke the custom class for performing caching operations\&. If the parameter is omitted or set to
\fBNone\fR,
SCons
will use the default
SCons\&.CacheDir\&.CacheDir
class\&.
.sp
When derived\-file caching is being used and
\fBscons\fR
finds a derived file that needs to be rebuilt, it will first look in the cache to see if a file with matching
build signature
exists (indicating the input file(s) and build action(s) were identical to those for the current target), and if so, will retrieve the file from the cache\&.
\fBscons\fR
will report
Retrieved `file\*(Aq from cache
instead of the normal build message\&. If the derived file is not present in the cache,
\fBscons\fR
will build it and then place a copy of the built file in the cache, identified by its
build signature, for future use\&.
.sp
The
Retrieved `file\*(Aq from cache
messages are useful for human consumption, but less useful when comparing log files between
\fBscons\fR
runs which will show differences that are noisy and not actually significant\&. To disable, use the
\fB\-\-cache\-show\fR
option\&. With this option,
\fBscons\fR
changes printing to always show the action that would have been used to build the file without caching\&.
.sp
Derived\-file caching may be disabled for any invocation of
\fBscons\fR
by giving the
\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR
command line option; cache updating may be disabled, leaving cache fetching enabled, by giving the
\fB\-\-cache\-readonly\fR
option\&.
.sp
If the
\fB\-\-cache\-force\fR
option is used,
\fBscons\fR
will place a copy of
\fIall\fR
derived files into the cache, even if they already existed and were not built by this invocation\&. This is useful to populate a cache the first time a
\fIcache_dir\fR
is used for a build, or to bring a cache up to date after a build with cache updating disabled (\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR
or
\fB\-\-cache\-readonly\fR) has been done\&.
.sp
The
\fBNoCache\fR
method can be used to disable caching of specific files\&. This can be useful if inputs and/or outputs of some tool are impossible to predict or prohibitively large\&.
.sp
Note that (at this time)
SCons
provides no facilities for managing the derived\-file cache\&. It is up to the developer to arrange for cache pruning, expiry, access control, etc\&. if needed\&.

The
\fBCommand\fR
function accepts
\fIsource_scanner\fR,
\fItarget_scanner\fR,
\fIsource_factory\fR, and
\fItarget_factory\fR
keyword arguments\&. These arguments can be used to specify a Scanner object that will be used to apply a custom scanner for a source or target\&. For example, the global
DirScanner
object can be used if any of the sources will be directories that must be scanned on\-disk for changes to files that aren\*(Aqt already specified in other Builder of function calls\&. The
\fI*_factory\fR

\fBCommand\fR

An action can be an external command, specified as a string, or a callable

It is not mandatory to call

Returns Directory Node(s)\&. A Directory Node is an object that represents a directory\&.
\fIname\fR
can be a relative or absolute path or a list of such paths\&.
\fIdirectory\fR
is an optional directory that will be used as the parent directory\&. If no

\fIparse_flags\fR,

\fBExecute\fR(\fIaction, [actionargs \&.\&.\&.]\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.Execute(\fIaction, [actionargs \&.\&.\&.]\fR)
.RS 4
Executes an Action\&.
\fIaction\fR
may be an Action object or it may be a command\-line string, list of commands, or executable
Python
function, each of which will first be converted into an Action object and then executed\&. Any additional arguments to
\fBExecute\fR
are passed on to the
\fBAction\fR
factory function which actually creates the Action object (see the manpage section
Action Objects
for a description)\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Execute(Copy(\*(Aqfile\&.out\*(Aq, \*(Aqfile\&.in\*(Aq))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\fBExecute\fR
performs its action immediately, as part of the SConscript\-reading phase\&. There are no sources or targets declared in an
\fBExecute\fR
call, so any objects it manipulates will not be tracked as part of the
SCons
dependency graph\&. In the example above, neither
file\&.out
nor
file\&.in
will be tracked objects\&.
.sp

\fBExecute\fR
returns the exit value of the command or return value of the
Python
function\&.
\fBscons\fR
prints an error message if the executed
\fIaction\fR
fails (exits with or returns a non\-zero value), however it does
\fInot\fR, automatically terminate the build for such a failure\&. If you want the build to stop in response to a failed
\fBExecute\fR
call, you must explicitly check for a non\-zero return value:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
if Execute("mkdir sub/dir/ectory"):
    # The mkdir failed, don\*(Aqt try to build\&.
    Exit(1)

.RE
.PP
\fBExit\fR(\fI[value]\fR)
.RS 4
This tells
\fBscons\fR

(zero) is used if no value is specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBExport\fR(\fI[vars\&.\&.\&.], [key=value\&.\&.\&.]\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.Export(\fI[vars\&.\&.\&.], [key=value\&.\&.\&.]\fR)
.RS 4
Exports variables for sharing with other SConscript files\&. The variables are added to a global collection where they can be imported by other SConscript files\&.
\fIvars\fR
may be one or more strings, or a list of strings\&. If any string contains whitespace, it is split automatically into individual strings\&. Each string must match the name of a variable that is in scope during evaluation of the current SConscript file, or an exception is raised\&.
.sp
A
\fIvars\fR
argument may also be a dictionary or individual keyword arguments; in accordance with
Python
syntax rules, keyword arguments must come after any non\-keyword arguments\&. The dictionary/keyword form can be used to map the local name of a variable to a different name to be used for imports\&. See the Examples for an illustration of the syntax\&.
.sp

\fBExport\fR
calls are cumulative\&. Specifying a previously exported variable will replace the previous value in the collection\&. Both local variables and global variables can be exported\&.
.sp
To use an exported variable, an SConscript must call
\fBImport\fR
to bring it into its own scope\&. Importing creates an additional reference to the object that was originally exported, so if that object is mutable, changes made will be visible to other users of that object\&.
.sp
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment()
# Make env available for all SConscript files to Import()\&.
Export("env")

package = \*(Aqmy_name\*(Aq
# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:\&.
Export("env", "package")

# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:
Export(["env", "package"])

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export(debug=env)

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export({"debug": env})
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that the
\fBSConscript\fR
function also supports an
\fIexports\fR
argument that allows exporting one or more variables to the SConscript files invoked by that call (only)\&. See the description of that function for details\&.
.RE

\fBFile\fR(\fIname, [directory]\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.File(\fIname, [directory]\fR)
.RS 4
Returns File Node(s)\&. A File Node is an object that represents a file\&.
\fIname\fR
can be a relative or absolute path or a list of such paths\&.
\fIdirectory\fR
is an optional directory that will be used as the parent directory\&. If no
\fIdirectory\fR
is specified, the current script\*(Aqs directory is used as the parent\&.
.sp
If
\fIname\fR

\fIname\fR\&.

\fBFindFile\fR(\fIfile, dirs\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.FindFile(\fIfile, dirs\fR)
.RS 4
Search for

\fIdirs\fR\&.
\fIdirs\fR
may be a list of directory names or a single directory name\&. In addition to searching for files that exist in the filesystem, this function also searches for derived files that have not yet been built\&.
.sp
Example:

\fBFindPathDirs\fR(\fIvariable\fR)
.RS 4
Returns a function (actually a callable Python object) intended to be used as the
\fIpath_function\fR
of a Scanner object\&. The returned object will look up the specified
\fIvariable\fR
in a construction environment and treat the construction variable\*(Aqs value as a list of directory paths that should be searched (like
\fB$CPPPATH\fR,
\fB$LIBPATH\fR, etc\&.)\&.
.sp
Note that use of
\fBFindPathDirs\fR
is generally preferable to writing your own
\fIpath_function\fR
for the following reasons: 1) The returned list will contain all appropriate directories found in source trees (when
\fBVariantDir\fR
is used) or in code repositories (when
\fBRepository\fR
or the
\fB\-Y\fR
option are used)\&. 2) scons will identify expansions of
\fIvariable\fR
that evaluate to the same list of directories as, in fact, the same list, and avoid re\-scanning the directories for files, when possible\&.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
def my_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    # Code to scan file contents goes here\&.\&.\&.
    return include_files

Returns the list of nodes which serve as the source of the built files\&. It does so by inspecting the dependency tree starting at the optional argument
\fInode\fR
which defaults to the \*(Aq"\&."\*(Aq\-node\&. It will then return all leaves of
\fInode\fR\&. These are all children which have no further children\&.

\fBFlatten\fR(\fIsequence\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.Flatten(\fIsequence\fR)
.RS 4
Takes a sequence (that is, a
Python
list or tuple) that may contain nested sequences and returns a flattened list containing all of the individual elements in any sequence\&. This can be helpful for collecting the lists returned by calls to Builders; other Builders will automatically flatten lists specified as input, but direct
Python
manipulation of these lists does not\&.
.sp
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
foo = Object(\*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
bar = Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)

# Because `foo\*(Aq and `bar\*(Aq are lists returned by the Object() Builder,
# `objects\*(Aq will be a list containing nested lists:
objects = [\*(Aqf1\&.o\*(Aq, foo, \*(Aqf2\&.o\*(Aq, bar, \*(Aqf3\&.o\*(Aq]

# Passing such a list to another Builder is all right because
# the Builder will flatten the list automatically:
Program(source = objects)

# If you need to manipulate the list directly using Python, you need to
# call Flatten() yourself, or otherwise handle nested lists:

\fBGetBuildFailures\fR()
.RS 4
Returns a list of exceptions for the actions that failed while attempting to build targets\&. Each element in the returned list is a
BuildError
object with the following attributes that record various aspects of the build failure:
.sp

\&.node
The node that was being built when the build failure occurred\&.
.sp

\&.status
The numeric exit status returned by the command or Python function that failed when trying to build the specified Node\&.
.sp

\&.errstr
The SCons error string describing the build failure\&. (This is often a generic message like "Error 2" to indicate that an executed command exited with a status of 2\&.)
.sp

\&.filename
The name of the file or directory that actually caused the failure\&. This may be different from the
\&.node
attribute\&. For example, if an attempt to build a target named
sub/dir/target
fails because the
sub/dir
directory could not be created, then the
\&.node
attribute will be
sub/dir/target
but the
\&.filename
attribute will be
sub/dir\&.
.sp

\&.executor
The SCons Executor object for the target Node being built\&. This can be used to retrieve the construction environment used for the failed action\&.
.sp

\&.action
The actual SCons Action object that failed\&. This will be one specific action out of the possible list of actions that would have been executed to build the target\&.
.sp

\&.command
The actual expanded command that was executed and failed, after expansion of
\fB$TARGET\fR,
\fB$SOURCE\fR, and other construction variables\&.
.sp
Note that the
\fBGetBuildFailures\fR
function will always return an empty list until any build failure has occurred, which means that
\fBGetBuildFailures\fR
will always return an empty list while the
SConscript
files are being read\&. Its primary intended use is for functions that will be executed before SCons exits by passing them to the standard Python
\fBatexit\&.register\fR() function\&. Example:
.sp

.RS 4
Returns a possibly empty list of Nodes (or strings) that match pathname specification
\fIpattern\fR\&.
\fIpattern\fR
can be absolute, top\-relative, or (most commonly) relative to the directory of the current
SConscript
file\&.
\fBGlob\fR
matches both files stored on disk and Nodes which
SCons
already knows about, even if any corresponding file is not currently stored on disk\&. The evironment method form (\fBenv\&.Glob\fR) performs string substition on
\fIpattern\fR
and returns whatever matches the resulting expanded pattern\&. The results are sorted, unlike for the similar
Python
glob\&.glob
function, to ensure build order will be stable\&.
.sp

\fIpattern\fR
can contain POSIX\-style shell metacharacters for matching:

T}
.TE
.sp 1
For a literal match, wrap the metacharacter in brackets to escape the normal behavior\&. For example,
\*(Aq[?]\*(Aq
matches the character
\*(Aq?\*(Aq\&.
.sp
Filenames starting with a dot are specially handled \- they can only be matched by patterns that start with a dot (or have a dot immediately following a pathname separator character, or slash), they are not not matched by the metacharacters\&. Metacharacter matches also do not span directory separators\&.
.sp

\fBGlob\fR
understands repositories (see the
\fBRepository\fR
function) and source directories (see the
\fBVariantDir\fR
function) and returns a Node (or string, if so configured) match in the local (SConscript) directory if a matching Node is found anywhere in a corresponding repository or source directory\&.
.sp
If the optional
\fIondisk\fR
argument evaluates false, the search for matches on disk is disabled, and only matches from already\-configured File or Dir Nodes are returned\&. The default is to return Nodes for matches on disk as well\&.
.sp
If the optional
\fIsource\fR
argument evaluates true, and the local directory is a variant directory, then
\fBGlob\fR
returnes Nodes from the corresponding source directory, rather than the local directory\&.
.sp
If the optional
\fIstrings\fR
argument evaluates true,
\fBGlob\fR
returns matches as strings, rather than Nodes\&. The returned strings will be relative to the local (SConscript) directory\&. (Note that while this may make it easier to perform arbitrary manipulation of file names, it loses the context
SCons
would have in the Node, so if the returned strings are passed to a different
SConscript
file, any Node translation there will be relative to that
SConscript
directory, not to the original
SConscript
directory\&.)
.sp
The optional
\fIexclude\fR
argument may be set to a pattern or a list of patterns descibing files or directories to filter out of the match list\&. Elements matching a least one specified pattern will be excluded\&. These patterns use the same syntax as for
\fIpattern\fR\&.

Zip("/tmp/everything", Glob("\&.??*") + Glob("*"))

.sp
On the first call to
\fBHelp\fR, if

.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def my_progress_function(node, *args, **kwargs):
    print(\*(AqEvaluating node %s!\*(Aq % node)
Progress(my_progress_function, interval=10)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A more complicated example of a custom progress display object that prints a string containing a count every 100 evaluated Nodes\&. Note the use of
\er
(a carriage return) at the end so that the string will overwrite itself on a display:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import sys
class ProgressCounter(object):
    count = 0
    def __call__(self, node, *args, **kw):
        self\&.count += 100
        sys\&.stderr\&.write(\*(AqEvaluated %s nodes\er\*(Aq % self\&.count)

Progress(ProgressCounter(), interval=100)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the first argument to
\fBProgress\fR
is a string or list of strings, it is taken as text to be displayed every
\fIinterval\fR
evaluated Nodes\&. If the first argument is a list of strings, then each string in the list will be displayed in rotating fashion every
\fIinterval\fR
evaluated Nodes\&.
.sp
The default is to print the string on standard output\&. An alternate output stream may be specified with the
\fIfile\fR
keyword argument, which the caller must pass already opened\&.
.sp
The following will print a series of dots on the error output, one dot for every 100 evaluated Nodes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import sys
Progress(\*(Aq\&.\*(Aq, interval=100, file=sys\&.stderr)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the string contains the verbatim substring
$TARGET;, it will be replaced with the Node\&. Note that, for performance reasons, this is
\fInot\fR
a regular SCons variable substition, so you can not use other variables or use curly braces\&. The following example will print the name of every evaluated Node, using a carriage return) (\er) to cause each line to overwritten by the next line, and the
\fIoverwrite\fR
keyword argument (default
False) to make sure the previously\-printed file name is overwritten with blank spaces:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import sys
Progress(\*(Aq$TARGET\er\*(Aq, overwrite=True)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A list of strings can be used to implement a "spinner" on the user\*(Aqs screen as follows, changing every five evaluated Nodes:
.sp
.if n \{\

This indicates that each given
\fItarget\fR
should not be created by the build rule, and if the target is created, an error will be generated\&. This is similar to the gnu make \&.PHONY target\&. However, in the vast majority of cases, an

\fBRepository\fR(\fIdirectory\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.Repository(\fIdirectory\fR)
.RS 4
Specifies that
\fIdirectory\fR
is a repository to be searched for files\&. Multiple calls to
\fBRepository\fR
are legal, and each one adds to the list of repositories that will be searched\&.
.sp
To
\fBscons\fR, a repository is a copy of the source tree, from the top\-level directory on down, which may contain both source files and derived files that can be used to build targets in the local source tree\&. The canonical example would be an official source tree maintained by an integrator\&. If the repository contains derived files, then the derived files should have been built using
\fBscons\fR, so that the repository contains the necessary signature information to allow
\fBscons\fR
to figure out when it is appropriate to use the repository copy of a derived file, instead of building one locally\&.
.sp
Note that if an up\-to\-date derived file already exists in a repository,
\fBscons\fR
will
\fInot\fR
make a copy in the local directory tree\&. In order to guarantee that a local copy will be made, use the
\fBLocal\fR

\fBReturn\fR(\fI[vars\&.\&.\&., stop=True]\fR)
.RS 4
Return to the calling SConscript, optionally returning the values of variables named in
\fIvars\fR\&. Multiple strings contaning variable names may be passed to
\fBReturn\fR\&. A string containing white space is split into individual variable names\&. Returns the value if one variable is specified, else returns a tuple of values\&. Returns an empty tuple if
\fIvars\fR

.sp
By default
\fBReturn\fR
stops processing the current SConscript and returns immediately\&. The optional
stop
keyword argument may be set to a false value to continue processing the rest of the SConscript file after the
\fBReturn\fR
call (this was the default behavior prior to SCons 0\&.98\&.) However, the values returned are still the values of the variables in the named

.RS 4
Executes subsidiary SConscript (build configuration) file(s)\&. There are two ways to call the
\fBSConscript\fR
function\&.
.sp
The first calling style is to supply one or more SConscript file names as the first positional argument, which can be a string or a list of strings\&. If there is a second positional argument, it is treated as if the
\fIexports\fR
keyword argument had been given (see below)\&. Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SConscript(\*(AqSConscript\*(Aq)  # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(\*(Aqsrc/SConscript\*(Aq)  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript([\*(Aqsrc/SConscript\*(Aq, \*(Aqdoc/SConscript\*(Aq])
SConscript(Split(\*(Aqsrc/SConscript doc/SConscript\*(Aq))
config = SConscript(\*(AqMyConfig\&.py\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The second calling style is to omit the positional argument naming the script and instead specify directory names using the
\fIdirs\fR
keyword argument\&. The value can be a string or list of strings\&. In this case,
\fBscons\fR
will execute a subsidiary configuration file named
SConscript
(by default) in each of the specified directories\&. You may specify a name other than
SConscript
by supplying an optional
\fIname\fR=\fIscriptname\fR
keyword argument\&. The first three examples below have the same effect as the first three examples above:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SConscript(dirs=\*(Aq\&.\*(Aq)  # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(dirs=\*(Aqsrc\*(Aq)  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(dirs=[\*(Aqsrc\*(Aq, \*(Aqdoc\*(Aq])
SConscript(dirs=[\*(Aqsub1\*(Aq, \*(Aqsub2\*(Aq], name=\*(AqMySConscript\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The optional
\fIexports\fR
keyword argument specifies variables to make available for use by the called SConscripts, which are evaluated in an isolated context and otherwise do not have access to local variables from the calling SConscript\&. The value may be a string or list of strings representing variable names, or a dictionary mapping local names to the names they can be imported by\&. For the first (scriptnames) calling style, a second positional argument will also be interpreted as
\fIexports\fR; the second (directory) calling style accepts no positional arguments and must use the keyword form\&. These variables are locally exported only to the called SConscript file(s), and take precedence over any same\-named variables in the global pool managed by the
\fBExport\fR
function\&.
The subsidiary SConscript files must use the
\fBImport\fR
function to import the variables into their local scope\&. Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
foo = SConscript(\*(Aqsub/SConscript\*(Aq, exports=\*(Aqenv\*(Aq)
SConscript(\*(Aqdir/SConscript\*(Aq, exports=[\*(Aqenv\*(Aq, \*(Aqvariable\*(Aq])
SConscript(dirs=\*(Aqsubdir\*(Aq, exports=\*(Aqenv variable\*(Aq)
SConscript(dirs=[\*(Aqone\*(Aq, \*(Aqtwo\*(Aq, \*(Aqthree\*(Aq], exports=\*(Aqshared_info\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the optional
\fIvariant_dir\fR
argument is present, it causes an effect equivalent to the
\fBVariantDir\fR
function, but in effect only within the scope of the
\fBSConscript\fR
call\&. The
\fIvariant_dir\fR
argument is interpreted relative to the directory of the
\fIcalling\fR
SConscript file\&. The source directory is the directory in which the
\fIcalled\fR
SConscript file resides and the SConscript file is evaluated as if it were in the
\fIvariant_dir\fR
directory\&. Thus:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SConscript(\*(Aqsrc/SConscript\*(Aq, variant_dir=\*(Aqbuild\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
is equivalent to:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
VariantDir(\*(Aqbuild\*(Aq, \*(Aqsrc\*(Aq)
SConscript(\*(Aqbuild/SConscript\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
If the sources are in the same directory as the
SConstruct,
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SConscript(\*(AqSConscript\*(Aq, variant_dir=\*(Aqbuild\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
is equivalent to:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
VariantDir(\*(Aqbuild\*(Aq, \*(Aq\&.\*(Aq)
SConscript(\*(Aqbuild/SConscript\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The optional
\fIduplicate\fR
argument is interpreted as for
\fBVariantDir\fR\&. If the
\fIvariant_dir\fR
argument is omitted, the
\fIduplicate\fR
argument is ignored\&. See the description of
\fBVariantDir\fR
for additional details and restrictions\&.
.sp

.sp
If the optional
\fImust_exist\fR
is
\fBTrue\fR
(the default), an exception is raised if a requested SConscript file is not found\&. To allow missing scripts to be silently ignored (the default behavior prior to
SCons
version 3\&.1), pass
must_exist=False

\fBSConscript\fR
call\&.

Specify where to store the
SCons
file signature database, and which database format to use\&. This may be useful to specify alternate database files and/or file locations for different types of builds\&.
.sp
The optional
\fIname\fR
argument is the base name of the database file(s)\&. If not an absolute path name, these are placed relative to the directory containing the top\-level
SConstruct
file\&. The default is
\&.sconsign\&. The actual database file(s) stored on disk may have an appropriate suffix appended by the chosen
\fIdbm_module\fR
.sp
The optional
\fIdbm_module\fR
argument specifies which
Python
database module to use for reading/writing the file\&. The module must be imported first; then the imported module name is passed as the argument\&. The default is a custom
SCons\&.dblite
module that uses pickled
Python
data structures, which works on all
Python
versions\&. See documentation of the
Python
dbm
module for other available types\&.
.sp
If called with no arguments, the database will default to
\&.sconsign\&.dblite
in the top directory of the project, which is also the default if if
\fBSConsignFile\fR
is not called\&.
.sp
The setting is global, so the only difference between the global function and the environment method form is variable expansion on
\fIname\fR\&. There should only be one active call to this function/method in a given build setup\&.
.sp
If
\fIname\fR
is set to
\fBNone\fR,
\fBscons\fR
will store file signatures in a separate
\&.sconsign
file in each directory, not in a single combined database file\&. This is a backwards\-compatibility meaure to support what was the default behavior prior to
SCons
0\&.97 (i\&.e\&. before 2008)\&. Use of this mode is discouraged and may be deprecated in a future

\fBSideEffect\fR(\fIside_effect, target\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.SideEffect(\fIside_effect, target\fR)
.RS 4
Declares
\fIside_effect\fR
as a side effect of building
\fItarget\fR\&. Both
\fIside_effect\fR
and
\fItarget\fR
can be a list, a file name, or a node\&. A side effect is a target file that is created or updated as a side effect of building other targets\&. For example, a Windows PDB file is created as a side effect of building the \&.obj files for a static library, and various log files are created updated as side effects of various TeX commands\&. If a target is a side effect of multiple build commands,
\fBscons\fR
will ensure that only one set of commands is executed at a time\&. Consequently, you only need to use this method for side\-effect targets that are built as a result of multiple build commands\&.
.sp
Because multiple build commands may update the same side effect file, by default the
\fIside_effect\fR
target is
\fInot\fR
automatically removed when the
\fItarget\fR
is removed by the
\fB\-c\fR
option\&. (Note, however, that the
\fIside_effect\fR
might be removed as part of cleaning the directory in which it lives\&.) If you want to make sure the
\fIside_effect\fR
is cleaned whenever a specific
\fItarget\fR
is cleaned, you must specify this explicitly with the
\fBClean\fR

\fBenv\&.Clean\fR

This function returns the list of side effect Node objects that were successfully added\&. If the list of side effects contained any side effects that had already been added, they are not added and included in the returned list\&.

\fBSplit\fR(\fIarg\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.Split(\fIarg\fR)

If
\fIarg\fR
is a string, splits on whitespace and returns a list of strings without whitespace\&. This mode is the most common case, and can be used to split a list of filenames (for example) rather than having to type them as a list of individually quoted words\&. If
\fIarg\fR
is a list or tuple returns the list or tuple unchanged\&. If
\fIarg\fR
is any other type of object, returns a list containing just the object\&. These non\-string cases do not actually do any spliting, but allow an argument variable to be passed to

Performs

${\fIexpression\fR}, although if there is no ambiguity in recognizing the element, the braces can be omitted\&. A literal
\fB$\fR

\fB$$\fR\&.
.sp
By default, leading or trailing white space will be removed from the result, and all sequences of white space will be compressed to a single space character\&. Additionally, any
$(

$)
character sequences will be stripped from the returned string, The optional
\fIraw\fR

$(\-$)
sequences\&. The
\fIraw\fR

.sp
If
\fIinput\fR
is a sequence (list or tuple), the individual elements of the sequence will be expanded, and the results will be returned as a list\&.

The optional
\fItarget\fR

Returned string values or sequence elements are converted to their string representation by default\&. The optional

\fBValidateOptions\fR(\fI[throw_exception=False]\fR)
.RS 4
Check that all the options specified on the command line are either
SCons
built\-in options or defined via calls to
\fBAddOption\fR\&.
SCons
will eventually fail on unknown options anyway, but calling this function allows the build to "fail fast" before executing expensive logic later in the build\&.
.sp
This function should only be called after the last
\fBAddOption\fR
call in your
SConscript
logic\&. Be aware that some tools call
\fBAddOption\fR, if you are getting error messages for arguments that they add, you will need to ensure that those tools are loaded before calling
\fBValidateOptions\fR\&.
.sp
If there are any unknown command line options,
\fBValidateOptions\fR
prints an error message and exits with an error exit status\&. If the optional
\fIthrow_exception\fR
argument is
True
(default is
False), a
SConsBadOptionError
is raised, giving an opportunity for the
SConscript
logic to catch that exception and handle invalid options appropriately\&. Note that this exception name needs to be imported (see the example below)\&.
.sp
A common build problem is typos (or thinkos) \- a user enters an option that is just a little off the expected value, or perhaps a different word with a similar meaning\&. It may be useful to abort the build before going too far down the wrong path\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\

Here
SCons
could go off and run a bunch of configure steps with the default value of
\-\-compiler, since the incorrect command line did not actually supply a value to it, costing developer time to track down why the configure logic made the "wrong" choices\&. This example shows catching this:

\fBstr\fR(\fIvalue\fR) changes between SCons runs, any targets depending on
\fBValue\fR(\fIvalue\fR) will be rebuilt\&. (This is true even when using timestamps to decide if files are up\-to\-date\&.) When using timestamp source signatures, Value Nodes\*(Aq timestamps are equal to the system time when the Node is created\&.
.sp
The returned Value Node object has a
\fBwrite\fR() method that can be used to "build" a Value Node by setting a new value\&. The optional
\fIbuilt_value\fR

\fBVariantDir\fR(\fIvariant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate]\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.VariantDir(\fIvariant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate]\fR)
.RS 4
Sets up a mapping to define a variant build directory in
\fIvariant_dir\fR\&.
\fIsrc_dir\fR
may not be underneath
\fIvariant_dir\fR\&. A
\fBVariantDir\fR
mapping is global, even if called using the
\fBenv\&.VariantDir\fR
form\&.
\fBVariantDir\fR
can be called multiple times with the same
\fIsrc_dir\fR
to set up multiple variant builds with different options\&.
.sp
Note if
\fIvariant_dir\fR
is not under the project top directory, target selection rules will not pick targets in the variant directory unless they are explicitly specified\&.
.sp
When files in
\fIvariant_dir\fR
are referenced,
SCons
backfills as needed with files from
\fIsrc_dir\fR
to create a complete build directory\&. By default,
SCons
physically duplicates the source files, SConscript files, and directory structure as needed into the variant directory\&. Thus, a build performed in the variant directory is guaranteed to be identical to a build performed in the source directory even if intermediate source files are generated during the build, or if preprocessors or other scanners search for included files using paths relative to the source file, or if individual compilers or other invoked tools are hard\-coded to put derived files in the same directory as source files\&. Only the files
SCons
calculates are needed for the build are duplicated into
\fIvariant_dir\fR\&. If possible on the platform, the duplication is performed by linking rather than copying\&. This behavior is affected by the
\fB\-\-duplicate\fR
command\-line option\&.
.sp
Duplicating the source files may be disabled by setting the
\fIduplicate\fR
argument to
\fBFalse\fR\&. This will cause
SCons
to invoke Builders using the path names of source files in
\fIsrc_dir\fR
and the path names of derived files within
\fIvariant_dir\fR\&. This is more efficient than duplicating, and is safe for most builds; revert to
duplicate=True
if it causes problems\&.
.sp

\fBVariantDir\fR
works most naturally when used with a subsidiary SConscript file\&. The subsidiary SConscript file must be called as if it were in
\fIvariant_dir\fR, regardless of the value of
\fIduplicate\fR\&. When calling an SConscript file, you can use the
\fIexports\fR
keyword argument to pass parameters (individually or as an appropriately set up environment) so the SConscript can pick up the right settings for that variant build\&. The SConscript must
\fBImport\fR
these to use them\&. Example:

The Visual C++ compiler option that

\fBLIBS\fR
.RS 4
The list of libraries that will be added to the link line for linking with any executable program, shared library, or loadable module created by the
construction environment
or override\&.
.sp
For portability, a string\-valued library name should include only the base library name, without prefixes such as
lib
or suffixes such as
\&.so
or
\&.dll\&.
SCons
\fIwill\fR
attempt to strip prefixes from the
\fB$LIBPREFIXES\fR
list and suffixes from the
\fB$LIBSUFFIXES\fR
list, but depending on that behavior will make the build less portable: for example, on a POSIX system, no attempt will be made to strip a suffix like
\&.dll\&. Library name strings in
\fB$LIBS\fR
should not include a path component: instead use
\fB$LIBPATH\fR
to direct the compiler to look for libraries in those paths, plus any default paths the linker searches in\&. If
\fB$LIBLITERALPREFIX\fR
is set to a non\-empty string, then a string\-valued
\fB$LIBS\fR
entry that starts with
\fB$LIBLITERALPREFIX\fR
will cause the rest of the entry to be searched for for unmodified, but respecting normal library search paths (this is an exception to the guideline above about leaving off the prefix/suffix from the library name)\&.
.sp
If a
\fB$LIBS\fR
entry is a Node object (either as returned by a previous Builder call, or as the result of an explicit call to
\fBFile\fR), the pathname from that Node will be added to
\fB$_LIBFLAGS\fR, and thus to the link line, unmodified \- without adding
\fB$LIBLINKPREFIX\fR
or
\fB$LIBLINKSUFFIX\fR\&. Such entries are searched for literally (including any path component); the library search paths are not used\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Append(LIBS=File(\*(Aq/tmp/mylib\&.so\*(Aq))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp

For each
Builder
call that causes linking with libraries,
SCons
will add the libraries in the setting of
\fB$LIBS\fR
in effect at that moment to the dependecy graph as dependencies of the target being generated\&.
.sp
The library list will transformed to command line arguments through the automatically\-generated
\fB$_LIBFLAGS\fR
construction variable
which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending the values of the
\fB$LIBLINKPREFIX\fR

\fB$LIBLINKSUFFIX\fR

Any command lines you define yourself that need the libraries from

The Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file that will store debugging information for object files, shared libraries, and programs\&. This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual C++\&.

.if n \{\

.sp
The Visual C++ compiler switch that SCons uses by default to generate PDB information is
\fB/Z7\fR\&. This works correctly with parallel (\fB\-j\fR) builds because it embeds the debug information in the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single PDB file between multiple object files\&. This is also the only way to get debug information embedded into a static library\&. Using the
\fB/Zi\fR
instead may yield improved link\-time performance, although parallel builds will no longer work\&. You can generate PDB files with the

Often when building software, some variables need to be specified at build time\&. For example, libraries needed for the build may be in non\-standard locations, or site\-specific compiler options may need to be passed to the compiler\&.
SCons
provides a
\fBVariables\fR
object to support overriding
construction variables
with values obtained from various sources, often from the command line:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
\fBscons VARIABLE=foo\fR
.fi
.if n \{\

The variable values can also be specified in a configuration file or an

file\&.

\fBVariables\fR

.PP
\fBVariables\fR([\fIfiles, [args]]\fR)
.RS 4
If
\fIfiles\fR
is a file or list of files, they are executed as Python scripts, and the values of (global) Python variables set in those files are added as
construction variables
in the
Default Environment\&. If no files are specified, or the
\fIfiles\fR
argument is
\fBNone\fR, then no files will be read (supplying
\fBNone\fR
is necessary if there are no files but you want to specify
\fIargs\fR

.sp
.if n \{\

.nf

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If
\fIargs\fR
is specified, it is a dictionary of values that will override anything read from
\fIfiles\fR\&. The primary use is to pass the
\fIARGUMENTS\fR
dictionary that holds variables specified on the command line, allowing you to indicate that if a setting appears on both the command line and in the file(s), the command line setting takes precedence\&. However, any dictionary can be passed\&. Examples:
.sp

\fIkey\fR
is either the name of the variable, or a tuple (or list), in which case the first item in the tuple is taken as the variable name, and any remaining values are considered aliases for the variable\&.
\fIhelp\fR
is the help text for the variable (default empty string)\&.
\fIdefault\fR
is the default value of the variable (default
\fBNone\fR)\&. If
\fIdefault\fR

\fBNone\fR
and a value is not specified, the
construction variable
will not be added to the
construction environment\&.
.sp
As a special case, if
\fIkey\fR
is a tuple (or list) and is the
\fIonly\fR

\fBAdd\fR
to consume a tuple emitted by the convenience functions
\fBBoolVariable\fR,
\fBEnumVariable\fR,
\fBListVariable\fR,
\fBPackageVariable\fR
and
\fBPathVariable\fR\&.
.sp
If the optional
\fIvalidator\fR
is supplied, it is called to validate the value of the variable\&. A function supplied as a validator must accept three arguments:
\fIkey\fR,
\fIvalue\fR
and
\fIenv\fR, and should raise an exception with a helpful error message if
\fIvalue\fR
is invalid\&. No return value is expected from the validator\&.
.sp
If the optional
\fIconverter\fR
is supplied, it is called to convert the value before putting it in the environment, and should take either a value or a value and environment as parameters\&. The converter function must return a value, which will be converted into a string and be passed to the

The

File and Directory Nodes (collectively, Filesystem Nodes) represent build components that correspond to an entry in the computer\*(Aqs filesystem, whether or not such an entry exists at the time the Node is created\&. You do not usually need to explicitly create filesystem Nodes, since when you supply a string as a target or source of a Builder,
SCons
will create the Nodes as needed to populate the dependency graph\&. Builders return the target Node(s) in the form of a list, which you can then make use of\&. However, since filesystem Nodes have some useful public attributes and methods that you can use in
SConscript
files, it is sometimes appropriate to create them manually, outside the regular context of a Builder call\&.

\fBValue and Alias Nodes\fR
.RS 4
.PP

SCons
provides two other Node types to represent object that will not have an equivalent filesystem entry\&. Such Nodes always need to be created explicitly\&.
.PP
The
\fBAlias\fR
method returns an Alias Node\&. Aliases are virtual objects \- they will not themselves result in physical objects being constructed, but are entered into the dependency graph related to their sources\&. An alias is checked for up to date by checking if its sources are up to date\&. An alias is built by making sure its sources have been built, and if any building took place, applying any Actions that are defined as part of the alias\&.
.PP
An
\fBAlias\fR
call creates an entry in the alias namespace, which is used for disambiguation\&. If an alias source has a string valued name, it will be resolved to a filesystem entry Node, unless it is found in the alias namespace, in which case it it resolved to the matching alias Node\&. As a result, the order of
\fBAlias\fR
calls is significant\&. An alias can refer to another alias, but only if the other alias has previously been created\&.
.PP
The
\fBValue\fR
method returns a Value Node\&. Value nodes are often used for generated data that will not have any corresponding filesystem entry, but will be used to determine whether a build target is out of date, or to include as part of a build Action\&. Common examples are timestamp strings, revision control version strings and other run\-time generated strings\&.
.PP
A Value Node can also be the target of a builder\&.
.RE
.SH "EXTENDING SCONS"
.PP

SCons
is designed to be extensible through provided facilities, so changing the code of
SCons
itself is only rarely needed to customize its behavior\&. A number of the main operations use callable objects which can be supplemented by writing your own\&. Builders, Scanners and Tools each use a kind of plugin system, allowing you to easily drop in new ones\&. Information about creating
Builder Objects
and
Scanner Objects
appear in the following sections\&. The instructions
SCons
actually uses to construct things are called Actions, and it is easy to create Action Objects and hand them to the objects that need to know about those actions (besides Builders, see
\fBAddPostAction\fR,
\fBAddPreAction\fR
and
\fBAlias\fR
for some examples of other places that take Actions)\&.
Action Objects
are also described below\&. Adding new Tool modules is described in
Tool Modules
.SS "Builder Objects"
.PP
\fBscons\fR
can be extended to build different types of targets by adding new Builder objects to a
construction environment\&.
\fIIn general\fR, you should only need to add a new Builder object when you want to build a new type of file or other external target\&. For output file types
\fBscons\fR
already knows about, you can usually modify the behavior of premade Builders such as
\fBProgram\fR,
\fBObject\fR
or
\fBLibrary\fR
by changing the
construction variables
they use (\fB$CC\fR,
\fB$LINK\fR, etc\&.)\&. In this manner you can, for example, change the compiler to use, which is simpler and less error\-prone than writing a new builder\&. The documentation for each Builder lists which
construction variables
it uses\&.
.PP
Builder objects are created using the
\fBBuilder\fR
factory function\&. Once created, a builder is added to an environment by entering it in the
\fB$BUILDERS\fR
dictionary in that environment (some of the examples in this section illustrate this)\&. Doing so automatically triggers
SCons
to add a method with the name of the builder to the environment\&.
.PP
The
\fBBuilder\fR
function accepts the following keyword arguments:
.PP
\fIaction\fR
.RS 4
The command used to build the target from the source\&.
\fIaction\fR
may be a string representing a template command line to execute, a list of strings representing the command to execute with its arguments (suitable for enclosing white space in an argument), a dictionary mapping source file name suffixes to any combination of command line strings (if the builder should accept multiple source file extensions), a Python function, an Action object (see
Action Objects) or a list of any of the above\&.
.sp
An action function must accept three arguments:
\fIsource\fR,
\fItarget\fR

\fIenv\fR\&.
\fIsource\fR

A function passed as

\fIsource\fR

The

\fBBuilder\fR, or other functions that take actions as arguments, by calling the
\fBAction\fR
factory function\&. This may more efficient when multiple Builder objects need to do the same thing rather than letting each of those Builder objects create a separate Action object\&. It also allows more flexible configuration of an Action object\&. For example, to control the message printed when the action is taken you need to create the action object using
\fBAction\fR\&.

\fIbatch_key\fR

If provided, indicates that the Action can create multiple target files by processing multiple independent source files simultaneously\&. (The canonical example is "batch compilation" of multiple object files by passing multiple source files to a single invocation of a compiler such as Microsoft\*(Aqs Visual C / C++ compiler\&.) If the
\fIbatch_key\fR
argument evaluates True and is not a callable object, the configured Action object will cause
\fBscons\fR
to collect all targets built with the Action object and configured with the same
construction environment
into single invocations of the Action object\*(Aqs command line or function\&. Command lines will typically want to use the
\fB$CHANGED_SOURCES\fR
construction variable

\fB$CHANGED_TARGETS\fR
as well) to only pass to the command line those sources that have actually changed since their targets were built\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\

.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
The
\fIbatch_key\fR
argument may also be a callable function that returns a key that will be used to identify different "batches" of target files to be collected for batch building\&. A
\fIbatch_key\fR
function must accept four parameters:
\fIaction\fR,
\fIenv\fR,
\fItarget\fR
and
\fIsource\fR\&. The first parameter,
\fIaction\fR, is the active action object\&. The second parameter,
\fIenv\fR, is the
construction environment
configured for the target\&. The
\fItarget\fR
and
\fIsource\fR
parameters are the lists of targets and sources for the configured action\&.
.sp
The returned key should typically be a tuple of values derived from the arguments, using any appropriate logic to decide how multiple invocations should be batched\&. For example, a
\fIbatch_key\fR
function may decide to return the value of a specific
construction variable
from
\fIenv\fR
which will cause
\fBscons\fR
to batch\-build targets with matching values of that
construction variable, or perhaps return the Python
\fBid\fR() of the entire
construction environment, in which case
\fBscons\fR
will batch\-build all targets configured with the same
construction environment\&. Returning
\fBNone\fR
indicates that the particular target should

\fBVariable Substitution\fR
.RS 4
.PP
Before executing a command,
\fBscons\fR
performs parameter expansion (substitution) on the string that makes up the action part of the builder\&. The format of a substitutable parameter is
${\fIexpression\fR}\&. If
\fIexpression\fR
refers to a variable, the braces in
${\fIexpression\fR}
can be omitted
\fIunless\fR
the variable name is immediately followed by a character that could either be interpreted as part of the name, or is
Python
syntax such as
\fB[\fR
(for indexing/slicing) or
\fB\&.\fR
(for attribute access \- see
Special Attributes
below)\&.
.PP
If
\fIexpression\fR
refers to a
construction variable, it is replaced with the value of that variable in the
construction environment
at the time of execution\&. If
\fIexpression\fR
looks like a variable name but is not defined in the
construction environment
it is replaced with an empty string\&. If
\fIexpression\fR
refers to one of the
Special Variables
(see below) the corresponding value of the variable is substituted\&.
\fIexpression\fR
may also be a
Python
expression to be evaluated\&. See
Python Code Substitution
below for a description\&.
.PP
SCons
uses the following rules when converting
construction variables
into command line strings:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the value is a string it is interpreted as space delimited command line arguments\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command line arguments\&. Each element of the list is converted to a string\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

Anything that is not a list or string is converted to a string and interpreted as a single command line argument\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Newline characters (\en) delimit lines\&. The newline parsing is done after all other parsing, so it is not possible for arguments (e\&.g\&. file names) to contain embedded newline characters\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

For a literal
\fB$\fR
use
\fB$$\fR\&. For example,
$$FOO
will be left in the final string as
$FOO\&.
.RE
.PP
When a build action is executed, a hash of the command line is saved, together with other information about the target(s) built by the action, for future use in rebuild determination\&. This is called the
build signature
(or
build action signature)\&. The escape sequence
\fB$(\fR
\fIsubexpression\fR
\fB$)\fR
may be used to indicate parts of a command line that may change without causing a rebuild\-\-that is, which are not to be included when calculating the
build signature\&. All text from
\fB$(\fR
up to and including the matching
\fB$)\fR
will be removed from the command line before it is added to the
build signature
while only the
\fB$(\fR
and
\fB$)\fR
will be removed before the command is executed\&. For example, the command line string:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
"echo Last build occurred $( $TODAY $)\&. > $TARGET"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
would execute the command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
echo Last build occurred $TODAY\&. > $TARGET
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
but the
build signature
added to any target files would be computed from:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
echo Last build occurred  \&. > $TARGET
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
While
construction variables
are normally directly substituted, if a
construction variable
has a value which is a callable
Python
object (a function, or a class with a
__call__
method), that object is called during substitution\&. The callable must accept four arguments:
\fItarget\fR,
\fIsource\fR,
\fIenv\fR
and
\fIfor_signature\fR\&.
\fIsource\fR
is a list of source nodes,
\fItarget\fR
is a list of target nodes,
\fIenv\fR
is the
construction environment
to use for context, and
\fIfor_signature\fR
is a boolean value that tells the callable if it is being called for the purpose of generating a
build signature\&. Since the
build signature
is used for rebuild determination, variable elements that do not affect whether a rebuild should be triggered should be omitted from the returned string if
\fIfor_signature\fR
is true\&. See
\fB$(\fR
and
\fB$)\fR
above for the syntax\&.
.PP

SCons
will insert whatever the callable returns into the expanded string:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def foo(target, source, env, for_signature):
    return "bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "bar baz"
env = Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="$FOO baz")
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
As a reminder, substitution happens when
$BAR
is actually used in a builder action\&. The value of
env[\*(AqBAR\*(Aq]
will be exactly as it was set:
"$FOO baz"\&. This can make debugging tricky, as the substituted result is not available at the time the
SConscript
files are being interpreted and thus not available to the
print
function\&. However, you can perform the substitution on demand by calling the
\fBenv\&.subst\fR
method for this purpose\&.
.PP
You can use this feature to pass arguments to a callable variable by creating a callable class that stores passed arguments in the instance, and then uses them (in the
__call__
method) when the instance is called\&. Note that in this case, the entire variable expansion must be enclosed by curly braces so that the arguments will be associated with the instantiation of the class:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
class foo:
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self\&.arg = arg

    def __call__(self, target, source, env, for_signature):
        return self\&.arg + " bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "my argument bar baz"

.SS "Scanner Objects"
.PP
Scanner objects are used to scan specific file types for implicit dependencies, for example embedded preprocessor/compiler directives that cause other files to be included during processing\&.
SCons
has a number of pre\-built Scanner objects, so it is usually only necessary to set up Scanners for new file types\&. You do this by calling the
\fBScanner\fR
factory function\&.
\fBScanner\fR
accepts the following arguments\&. Only
\fIfunction\fR
is required; the rest are optional:
.PP
\fIfunction\fR
.RS 4
A scanner function to call to process a given Node (usually a file) and return a list of Nodes representing the implicit dependencies (usually files) found in the contents\&. The function must accept three required arguments,
\fInode\fR,
\fIenv\fR
and
\fIpath\fR, and an optional fourth,
\fIarg\fR\&.
\fInode\fR
is the internal
SCons
node representing the file to scan,
\fIenv\fR
is the
construction environment
to use during the scan, and
\fIpath\fR
is a tuple of directories that can be searched for files, as generated by the optional scanner
\fIpath_function\fR
(see below)\&. If
\fIargument\fR
was supplied when the Scanner object was created, it is given as
\fIarg\fR
when the scanner function is called; since
\fIargument\fR
is optional, the default is no
\fIarg\fR\&.
.sp
The function can use use
\fBstr\fR(\fInode\fR) to fetch the name of the file,
\fInode\fR\&.\fBdir\fR
to fetch the directory the file is in,
\fInode\fR\&.\fBget_contents\fR() to fetch the contents of the file as bytes or
\fInode\fR\&.\fBget_text_contents\fR() to fetch the contents of the file as text\&.
.sp
The function must take into account the
\fIpath\fR
directories when generating the dependency Nodes\&. To illustrate this, a C language source file may contain a line like
#include "foo\&.h"\&. However, there is no guarantee that
foo\&.h
exists in the current directory: the contents of
\fB$CPPPATH\fR
is passed to the C preprocessor which will look in those places for the header, so the scanner function needs to look in those places as well in order to build Nodes with correct paths\&. Using
\fBFindPathDirs\fR
with an argument of
CPPPATH
as the
\fIpath_function\fR
in the
\fBScanner\fR
call means the scanner function will be called with the paths extracted from
\fB$CPPPATH\fR
in the environment
\fIenv\fR
passed as the
\fIpaths\fR
parameter\&.
.sp
Note that the file to scan is
\fInot\fR
guaranteed to exist at the time the scanner is called \- it could be a generated file which has not been generated yet \- so the scanner function must be tolerant of that\&.
.sp
Alternatively, you can supply a dictionary as the
\fIfunction\fR
parameter, to map keys (such as file suffixes) to other Scanner objects\&. A Scanner created this way serves as a dispatcher: the Scanner\*(Aqs
\fIskeys\fR
parameter is automatically populated with the dictionary\*(Aqs keys, indicating that the Scanner handles Nodes which would be selected by those keys; the mapping is then used to pass the file on to a different Scanner that would not have been selected to handle that Node based on its own
\fIskeys\fR\&.

\fIargument\fR

If specified, will be passed to the scanner function
\fIfunction\fR

.RE
.PP
\fIskeys\fR
.RS 4
Scanner key(s) indicating the file types this scanner is associated with\&. Used internally to select an appropriate scanner\&. In the usual case of scanning for file names, this argument will be a list of suffixes for the different file types that this Scanner knows how to scan\&. If
\fIskeys\fR
is a string, it will be expanded into a list by the current environment\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIpath_function\fR
.RS 4
A Python function that takes four or five arguments: a
construction environment, a Node for the directory containing the
SConscript
file in which the first target was defined, a list of target nodes, a list of source nodes, and the value of
\fIargument\fR
if it was supplied when the Scanner was created\&. Must return a tuple of directories that can be searched for files to be returned by this Scanner object\&. (Note that the
\fBFindPathDirs\fR
function can be used to return a ready\-made
\fIpath_function\fR

construction variable
name, instead of having to write your own function from scratch\&.)

Specifies whether this scanner should be re\-invoked on the dependency files returned by the scanner\&. If omitted, the Node subsystem will only invoke the scanner on the file being scanned and not recurse\&. Recursion is needed when the files returned by the scanner may themselves contain further file dependencies, as in the case of preprocessor
#include
lines\&. A value that evaluates true enables recursion;
\fIrecursive\fR
may be a callable function, in which case it will be called with a list of Nodes found and should return a list of Nodes that should be scanned recursively; this can be used to select a specific subset of Nodes for additional scanning\&.
.RE

Once created, a Scanner can added to an environment by setting it in the
\fB$SCANNERS\fR
list, which automatically triggers
SCons
to also add it to the environment as a method\&. However, usually a scanner is not truly standalone, but needs to be plugged in to the existing selection mechanism for deciding how to scan source files based on filename extensions\&. For this,
SCons
has a global
SourceFileScanner
object that is used by the
\fBObject\fR,
\fBSharedObject\fR
and
\fBStaticObject\fR
builders to decide which scanner should be used\&. You can use the
SourceFileScanner\&.add_scanner()
method to add your own Scanner object to the
SCons
infrastructure that builds target programs or libraries from a list of source files of different types:
.sp
.if n \{\

def xyz_scan(node, env, path):
    contents = node\&.get_text_contents()
    # Scan the contents and return the included files\&.

.SS "Tool Modules"
.PP
Additional tools can be added to a project either by placing them in a
site_tools
subdirectory of a site directory, or in a custom location specified to
\fBscons\fR
by giving the
\fItoolpath\fR
keyword argument to
\fBEnvironment\fR\&. A tool module is a form of Python module, invoked internally using the Python import mechanism, so a tool can consist either of a single source file taking the name of the tool (e\&.g\&.
mytool\&.py) or a directory taking the name of the tool (e\&.g\&.
mytool/) which contains at least an
__init__\&.py
file\&.
.PP
The
\fItoolpath\fR
parameter takes a list as its value:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdefault\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq], toolpath=[\*(Aqtools\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This looks for a tool specification module (mytool\&.py, or directory
mytool) in directory
tools
and in the standard locations, as well as using the ordinary default tools for the platform\&.
.PP
Directories specified via
\fItoolpath\fR
are prepended to the existing tool path\&. The default tool path is any
site_tools
directories, so tools in a specified
\fItoolpath\fR
take priority, followed by tools in a
site_tools
directory, followed by built\-in tools\&. For example, adding a tool specification module
gcc\&.py
to the toolpath directory would override the built\-in
gcc
tool\&. The tool path is stored in the environment and will be used by subsequent calls to the
\fBTool\fR
method, as well as by
\fBenv\&.Clone\fR\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.sp

.SH "SYSTEM-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR"
.PP
\fBscons\fR
and its configuration files are very portable, due largely to its implementation in Python\&. There are, however, a few portability issues waiting to trap the unwary\&.
.SS "\&.C File Suffix"
.PP
\fBscons\fR
handles the upper\-case
\&.C
file suffix differently, depending on the capabilities of the underlying system\&. On a case\-sensitive system such as Linux or UNIX,
\fBscons\fR
treats a file with a
\&.C
suffix as a C++ source file\&. On a case\-insensitive system such as Windows,
\fBscons\fR
treats a file with a
\&.C
suffix as a C source file\&.
.SS "Fortran File Suffixes"
.PP
There are several ways source file suffixes impact the behavior of
SCons
when working with Fortran language code (not all are system\-specific, but they are included here for completeness)\&.
.PP
As the Fortran language has evolved through multiple standards editions, projects might have a need to handle files from different language generations differently\&. To this end,
SCons
dispatches to a different compiler dialect setup (expressed as a set of
construction variables) depending on the file suffix\&. By default, all of these setups start out the same, but individual
construction variables
can be modified as needed to tune a given dialect\&. Each of these dialacts has a tool specification module whose documentation describes the
construction variables
associated with that dialect:
\&.f
(as well as
\&.for
and
\&.ftn) in
fortran; (construction variables
start with
FORTRAN)
\&.f77
in
f77; (construction variables
start with
F77)
\&.f90
in
f90; (construction variables
start with
F90)
\&.f95
in
f95; (construction variables
start with
F95)
\&.f03
in
f03; (construction variables
start with
F03)
\&.f08
in
f08
(construction variables
start with
F08)\&.
.PP
While
SCons
recognizes multiple internal dialects based on filename suffixes, the convention of various available Fortran compilers is to assign an actual meaning to only two of these suffixes:
\&.f
(as well as
\&.for
and
\&.ftn) refers to the fixed\-format source code that was the only available option in FORTRAN 77 and earlier, and
\&.f90
refers to free\-format source code which became available as of the Fortran 90 standard\&. Some compilers recognize suffixes which correspond to Fortran specifications later then F90 as equivalent to
\&.f90
for this purpose, while some do not \- check the documentation for your compiler\&. An occasionally suggested policy suggestion is to use only
\&.f
and
\&.f90
as Fortran filename suffixes\&. The fixed/free form determination can usually be controlled explicitly with compiler flags (e\&.g\&.
\fB\-ffixed\-form\fR
for gfortran), overriding any assumption that may be made based on the source file suffix\&.
.PP
The source file suffix does not imply conformance with the similarly\-named Fortran standard \- a suffix of
\&.f08
does not mean you are compiling specifically for Fortran 2008\&. Normally, compilers provide command\-line options for making this selection (e\&.g\&.
\fB\-std=f2008\fR
for gfortran)\&.
.PP
For dialects from F90 on (including the generic FORTRAN dialect), a suffix of
\&.mod
is recognized for Fortran modules\&. These files are a side effect of compiling a Fortran source file containing module declarations, and must be available when other code which declares that it uses the module is processed\&.
SCons
does not currently have integrated support for submodules, introduced in the Fortran 2008 standard \- the invoked compiler will produce results, but
SCons
will not recognize
\&.smod
files as tracked objects\&.
.PP
On a case\-sensitive system such as Linux or UNIX, a file with a an upper\-cased suffix from the set
\&.F,
\&.FOR,
\&.FTN,
\&.F90,
\&.F95,
\&.F03
and
\&.F08
is treated as a Fortran source file which shall first be run through the standard C preprocessor\&. The lower\-cased versions of these suffixes do not trigger this behavior\&. On systems which do not distinguish between uppper and lower case in filenames, this behavior is not available, but files suffixed with either
\&.FPP
or
\&.fpp
are always passed to the preprocessor first\&. This matches the convention of
\fBgfortran\fR
from the GNU Compiler Collection, and also followed by certain other Fortran compilers\&. For these two suffixes, the generic
\fIFORTRAN\fR
dialect will be selected\&.
.PP

SCons
itself does not invoke the preprocessor, that is handled by the compiler, but it adds
construction variables
which are applicable to the preprocessor run\&. You can see this difference by examining
\fB$FORTRANPPCOM\fR
and
\fB$FORTRANPPCOMSTR\fR
which are used instead of
\fB$FORTRANCOM\fR
and
\fB$FORTRANCOMSTR\fR
for that dialect\&.
.SS "Windows: Cygwin Tools and Cygwin Python vs\&. Windows Pythons"
.PP
Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities that let users work on a Windows system using a POSIX\-like environment\&. The Cygwin tools, including Cygwin
Python, do this, in part, by sharing an ability to interpret POSIX\-style path names\&. For example, the Cygwin tools will internally translate a Cygwin path name like
/cygdrive/c/mydir
to an equivalent Windows pathname of
C:/mydir
(equivalent to
C:\emydir)\&.
.PP
Versions of
Python
that are built for native Windows execution, such as the python\&.org and ActiveState versions, do not understand the Cygwin path name semantics\&. This means that using a native Windows version of
Python
to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools (such as
gcc,
bison
and
flex) may yield unpredictable results\&. "Mixing and matching" in this way can be made to work, but it requires careful attention to the use of path names in your
SConscript
files\&.
.PP
In practice, users can sidestep the issue by adopting the following guidelines: When using Cygwin\*(Aqs
gcc
for compiling, use the Cygwin\-supplied
Python
interpreter to run
\fBscons\fR; when using Microsoft Visual C/C++ (or some other "native" Windows compiler) use the python\&.org, Microsoft Store, ActiveState or other native version of
Python
to run
\fBscons\fR\&.
.PP
This discussion largely applies to the msys2 environment as well (with the use of the mingw compiler toolchain), in particular the recommendation to use the msys2 version of
Python
if running
\fBscons\fR
from inside an msys2 shell\&.
.SS "Windows: scons\&.bat file"
.PP
On Windows, if
\fBscons\fR
is executed via a wrapper
scons\&.bat
batch file, there are (at least) two ramifications\&. Note this is no longer the default \-
\fBscons\fR
installed via
Python\*(Aq\*(Aqs
\fBpip\fR
installer will have an
\fBscons\&.exe\fR
which does not have these limitations:
.PP
First, Windows command\-line users that want to use variable assignment on the command line may have to put double quotes around the assignments, otherwise the Windows command shell will consume those as arguments to itself, not to
\fBscons\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons "FOO=BAR" "BAZ=BLEH"\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Second, the Cygwin shell does not recognize typing
\fBscons\fR
at the command line prompt as referring to this wrapper\&. You can work around this either by executing
\fBscons\&.bat\fR
(including the extension) from the Cygwin command line, or by creating a wrapper shell script named
scons
which invokes
scons\&.bat\&.
.SS "MinGW"
.PP
The MinGW
bin
directory must be in your
\fBPATH\fR
environment variable or the
\fI[\*(AqENV\*(Aq][\*(AqPATH\*(Aq]\fR
construction variable
for
\fBscons\fR
to detect and use the MinGW tools\&. When running under the native Windows Python; interpreter,
\fBscons\fR
will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin tools, if they are both installed, regardless of the order of the bin directories in the
\fBPATH\fR
variable\&. If you have both MSVC and MinGW installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC, then you must explicitly tell
\fBscons\fR
to use MinGW by passing
tools=[\*(Aqmingw\*(Aq]
to the
\fBEnvironment\fR
function, because
\fBscons\fR
will prefer the MSVC tools over the MinGW tools\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
In general,
\fBscons\fR
is not controlled by environment variables set in the shell used to invoke it, leaving it up to the
SConscript
file author to import those if desired\&. However the following variables are imported by
\fBscons\fR
itself if set:
.PP
\fBSCONS_LIB_DIR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the directory that contains the
\fBscons\fR
Python module directory\&. Normally
\fBscons\fR
can deduce this, but in some circumstances, such as working with a source release, it may be necessary to specify (for example,
/home/aroach/scons\-src\-0\&.01/src/engine)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSCONSFLAGS\fR

\fBscons\fR

\fBSCONSFLAGS\fR

\fBSCONSFLAGS\fR
options if necessary\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSCONS_CACHE_MSVC_CONFIG\fR
.RS 4
(Windows only)\&. If set, save the shell environment variables generated when setting up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (and/or Build Tools) to a cache file, to give these settings persistence across
\fBscons\fR
invocations\&. Generating this information is relatively expensive, so using this option may aid performance where
\fBscons\fR
is run often, such as Continuous Integration setups\&.
.sp

"true"

.sp
Note: this implementation may still be somewhat fragile\&. In case of problems, remove the cache file \- recreating with fresh info normally resolves any issues\&.
SCons
